Other corner rd. is Long Island Pl. sewer is too far to help. The result, a constant pond and soot deposit that overflows onto my turf & bringing with it a constant weed infestation. All of the sitting water over the decades ruin the asphalt re-pavings. 3 re-pavings during my ownership, & it's time for another one. It'd be cheaper to grant us a corner sewer. Will they?

The pedestrian time is long because the total cycle length is long, not the other way around.  The cycle length is long that early in the morning to get ahead of the heavy volumes that are about to start.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4601318,"I do agree that the cycle time is longer than it used to be, before the pedestrian time was added, but I submit that it is not necessary for either the Ashford-Dunwoody traffic or pedestrians.

I've been driving this route for almost 4 years and I can count on one hand the number of pedestrians that have crossed this intersection between 6:00 and 6:15 AM when I go through it.  And, they have all crossed Ashford-Dunwoody, not Hammond.  So, there are, for all intents and purposes, no pedestrians to initiate the Hammond crosswalk signal.  

Between 6:00 and 6:15 AM there is no heavy traffic on Ashford-Dunwoody, unless another stoplight's timing is also messed up.  Getting ahead of traffic just slows the early traffic down unnecessarily.  Can you refine the time when the extended cycle must begin?

One other thought for the northbound Ashford-Dunwoody traffic turning onto Hammond; there is a busy intersection near my home with a high volume of traffic making a left turn.  To alleviate this, there is a left turn only at the beginning of the cycle and end of the cycle. Hope this is helpful.

Thanks

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4596228,"I already made a complaint about this more than 6 months ago. It's not storm damage. The new owners of the property decided to 'demolish' it using 3 guys in a pickup truck. I asked the city of EP in the complaint 6 months ago if a permit to demolish had been filed - no response on that point. I asked exactly how long the owners have to complete work once it was started because at that time the house had been in that state for at least 6 months - the permit office's response was that there was no time requirement, which seems crazy. My primary concern is public safety, in that the site is a disaster waiting to happen regarding people, pets and kids. It's not secured in any way and the whole floor with gaping holes is suspended above a debris (glass, bricks, boards with nails, etc) filled basement. 

It's an embarrassment to the city and represents financial exposure because the complaints are on record - the city has known about it for over a year now. If you dared to make a backyard deck more than 14 inches of the ground without a code-compliant handrail, the city of East Point would cite you.. The owners of this property must have some city connection(s) - I can think of no reason for the city of have let this situation go on so long.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4596228,"It's a version of the 80/20 rule. 80% of the properties which are the real horrors of Colonial Hill -- the properties that make the whole area look bad -- are investor or 'future' developer-owned properties. These owners intentionally *do not want to be found* -- they are interested in playing the longest game possible, playing rope-a-dope with the city, refusing to invest in even the most minimal of maintenance, and we are all suffering in the process.

The City of East Point needs to pull a few bucks off the top of the budget for all the new municipal building that's going on downtown and instead hire a some legal talent to go after the owners of these trash-piles. Fine them, or seize and sell the properties to responsible parties -- the short, the mayor and the other civil servants that we pay need to *do their job* -- other cities have read the riot act to owners like this, and in the process transformed neighborhoods for their constituents  -- Where is our man on the street Thomas Callahan in all this?

Thank you for your concern.  Prior to installation, the City carefully considered the options to provide safe and interesting crosswalks in our downtown area.  The selected material is designed to retain its color as it wears down over time.  For this reason,  the City does not have immediate plans to replace the current crosswalks. 

I understand that not all resident would choose this type of crosswalk.  However, since installation, we have not received many complaints about these crosswalks.  Some people prefer the new crosswalks and many seem to like them.   I would be happy to talk with you about this over a phone call especially if there are 2-3 specific places where the material has worn away.  You can reach me directly at 678.553.6570.

I often have to flag cars down by frantically waving my arms before crossing at one of the new crosswalks. This is not an issue that is solved with artistic solutions. We need safety in crossing.

This site is not under a stop work order. The contractors are allowed to work under the Notice of Violation.
I reinspected the site and the contractor has installed some erosion control measures and cleaned the sidewalk. It is still under violation and the contractor is moving forward to correcting his site.
Thank you again for your post.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4571586,"07-01-18: I realize that five business days may not have passed (unless June 25 is included), but the builder has still not replaced protection for the storm water drain nor removed the mud in the street/gutter from previous run-off along the left side of the lot (as you face it). 

BTW, allowing five business days for correction of a run-off problem involving mud into the storm drains during a time of year with regular afternoon thunderstorms seems overly generous. I suggest the city revisit that time period. Additionally, builders typically work Saturdays, so that day should be considered a ""business day"" for enforcement purposes.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4508545,"I see the issue is listed as completed however, has the work actually been completed or is it planned for this week?  If so, maybe they are in need of even more cutting back , as  I drove by there on Sunday and still had to come into the cross walk before I could see around the very large bushes.  The concern is not only the drivers not being able to see around the very large bushes, but the  cross walk being blocked by cars.  The people walking, the children walking to BrookRun, the families with strollers are not able to cross in the cross walk, I see them most of the time walking behind the cars in order to cross the street.  Can the tall bushes be trimmed back even further?   Looking forward to hearing back and I will reopen the issue.  Thanks for your help in keeping Dunwoody Safe.",2018-06-11T09:16:04-04:00,2018-06-11T09:16:09-04:00,1290177,Susan  Rothschild,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4481523,"Hallie is correct.  The RR boxcars are behind the small apartment building at 110 Pearl St.  SE. 30316. The corner of Field & Pearl.

The dumping has taken place every couple of months..  

This is the second 311 report that I know of.    I contacted Valencia Hudson, liaison to Natalyn Archibong, early Spring and bulk pickup arrived soon thereafter.

There’s a tale to tell on this mess.  The alleged owner of the boxcars, and one supposes, the apartment building has:

—Listed the property For Sale at $81,000 - signs hung on the chain link fencing in 2014

--Held curb sales at this location periodically for the past 2-3 years.  The items appear to have been stored in the boxcars.  Old junk with a few, very few, pieces of vintage furniture, a foot pedal sewing machine (White or Singer), lamps, clothing, toys, etc

On MLK Day, 2018, the area was cleaned by a volunteer from the neighborhood.   Some of the items were from a car broken into the previous Friday evening, and were returned to the rightful owner.  

Fresh flowers have found their way into a few of the piles.

This trash pile does not appear to be from the boxcars.   Perhaps junk from a recently vacated apartment in the 110 building?  Such as the apartment-sized refrigerator, door intact, near the Herbies Curbies at Frield & Pearl",2018-05-23T20:21:57-04:00,2018-05-23T20:21:57-04:00,1531042,Liz Hill,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for the information, I am still not clear we’re the city of Dunwoody property line is for the following reason. JW Collection’s The Enclave at Dunwoody on Pernoshal Ct, have staked their property line, which does not seem to agree where you mention the city property line is.

I have measured and photographed two of this stakes ( I will try to send them to you in a separate email) one stake is approximate 7 feet from the pavement and the other 10 feet from the pavement. So it will seem between the 3 of us there may be some confusion / error of the property line.

I am so sorry you have had this experience.  I have been reporting on this issue to East Point for more than a year, but the City does not care.

My daughter plays in my front yard right across the street from this location.  I worry that this dog might attack her.

We pay taxes, and pay rent or mortgage payments, we pay for utilities, and we are not able to even take an evening walk safely because folks that are paid with our tax dollars don't want to do their job.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4413515,"1. Communication: Can you send a notice to Councilmember Amir Farokhi so he can notify NPU-N constituents of any infrastructure projects in their neighborhood? Otherwise, all neighborhoods in the city have neighborhood organizations, in our case, the Candler Park Neighborhood Organization at board@candlerpark.org. #amirfarokhi

2. The final paving contractor was different than the initial underlayment contractor who did the shoddy job pictured above and who sparked a whole NextDoor conversation about burned bushes and trees. The second contractor didn't do a bad job, there is minor streaking issues though. https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=81131339

3. Who requested Page be paved? Page has been paved so many times over the years that the granite headers are in many places only an inch or two above the over-paved street. 

4. Meanwhile, one street over, Terrace, is down to the concrete and is a major thoroughfare to access the PATH for many bikers commuting to work. But it is missing granite headers along half the street. And needs a speed bump (traffic study) before the sidewalk egress from the Candler Park playground since that sidewalk is downhill from a sloped curve where many drivers are speeding due to momentum and gravity. Can we start service requests for Terrace Avenue including traffic study for the speed bump. Google Maps jpg will be downloaded later for exact locations. 

Again, please could the neighborhoods have more communication regarding a major road paving?  #amirfarokhi #candlerparkneighborhoodorganization 

Thanks.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4353667,"I just spoke to Solid Waste Manager, Sherra. I like her. There was a partial pickup. 8 tons of yard waste in Candler Park yesterday. They did miss a few on my street, but they picked up mine! 

They will pick up the remainder (Oakdale, Hooper, Candler Park Drive, etc. ) tomorrow or Saturday. I gave Sherra a heads up that this weekend is Inman Park Festival and many park in Candler Park and cross Moreland to get to the festival so waiting til Saturday is not ideal. 

She said she would rearrange things but that she'd take care of us, and that I can always call her. Yay!

On another note, when I called to escalate, I have to give the service request number. Since I'm using SeeClickFix, I can see what other service request numbers are for similar cases (Hooper) and I am consolidating service request numbers and target resolution dates. But the 311 phone operator told me I can't call about someone else's service request, just mine. I can't say, oh, 10 residents on Terrace Avenue even if I have a list of their service requests numbers. So, hmmm, there must be a better way to group escalate without having to go through our City Council rep, Amir Farokhi.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4336629,"The City of Dunwoody has received this issue, as service request #5588. Currently, we are working on this, please check back for status updates.",2018-04-14T11:14:09-04:00,2018-04-14T11:14:09-04:00,4976,Dunwoody Public Works,Verified Official,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4336629,"This intersection has more problems than just this. I have lived in Dunwoody for over 31 years and take Old Springhouse Lane to C D Rd in the morning to get to I-285. The increase in traffic volume over this time has been incredible as you can imagine. I'm sure the drivers on Dunwoody Park coming from the other direction are unhappy as well. It doesn't look like there is room for more lanes on C D Rd so options are limited. 
One particular problem is that the two lanes on Old Springhouse don't distribute the traffic efficiently. The left lane is for left turn only, while the right lane is for right turn and straight through. Probably 90% of all traffic on Old Springhouse will turn right to get to I 285 or continue on C D Rd. If one car tries to go straight and therefore sits through a red light, all behind it have to wait. 10% of traffic either go straight or turn left. Why does left turning traffic have its own lane? The right lane should be right turn only and the left lane should be shared between left turn and straight. Of course at 8 AM, the intersection is simply overwhelmed with traffic and it is a challenge to go in any direction. Perhaps coordinating lights here and at Georgetown shopping center and at Cotillion Dr would help some.
Another issue here is the light at the end of the access ramp onto I 285 westbound. That is absolutely the most useless thing anywhere. I can't tell you how many times the ramp is backed up onto C D Rd in both directions when that light is working. When it is turned off, the ramp clears within 2 minutes. That thing just adds injury to insult. A total waste of money.
Dunwoody has my sympathy in trying to ""fix"" this traffic issue. Like so many places in Atlanta, the traffic volume has overwhelmed the infrastructure. Hope there is a ""fix"" in the works.",2018-04-14T11:49:43-04:00,2018-04-14T11:49:44-04:00,1495624,seesomethingsaysomething,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4328855,"The City of Dunwoody really got screwed on the pavement job for Chamblee Dunwoody...The payment at the sewer just below Ashford Parkway gives you a thrill ride each time you go over it at any speed. The road is almost in as bad a shape now than it was before it was paved as it has been dug up and re-paved (?) several times since. When the road is dug up and re-paved invariably it will sink at the spot it was dug up--I think we need to have in the rules for digging up a street to require  the contractor must return in 120 or 180 days to re-pave where the pavement has sunk.  Dunwoody seems to do a half-job most of the time, for example, the serious hole in Chamblee-Dunwoody at Cotillion was only half filled when it was finally filled at all and now that hole is almost back to where it was before it was filled.",2018-04-12T07:52:17-04:00,2018-04-12T07:52:18-04:00,412288,sixty,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there a storm drain at this location already? We received a request on Facebook to have a storm drain unclogged. After reviewing Google Maps it doesn't appear there is one at this intersection so if you can clarify that would be great!

Your SeeClickFix ID number helps us locate your request on this website but our service request # helps us locate the request in our system. In regards to Page Ave, these 2 issues have to be kept separate since they are 2 different locations. Nothing should have to be torn down however, if it is, restoration will take place.

In other words, let's kick this can down the road. It's been several years already. There is a preschool in the adjacent building and preschoolers have to walk out into the middle of a major street thoroughfare (McLendon Avenue) to go around this puddle. 

I just want to know where this issue is in the queue and if there is a target resolution date. I will continue to reach out to Engineering, as other neighbors have done over the years, and at least I have a transparent open record here that can't be deleted.

Yes, and I actually have you on my calendar to respond to you today with an update.

We have investigated this issue to see what other contribution factors may be involved in this matter.  Our field engineer found a few stormwater basins in the area that needed cleaning and our Sewer Operation crews for Preventative Maintenance have cleaned out these structures.

While we believe that a continual overlay of pavement over the years has contributed to the ponding stormwater at this intersection, we are still looking at some financially feasible options to help reduce standing water at this location. We discussed this matter with the City’s Department of Public Works (DPW) at our monthly meeting this week and have asked their engineer to investigate what options DPW might have to help get positive drainage down to the nearest curb inlet.  Installing a new catch basin in the roadway would be very expensive and there are numerous other issues that can be addressed that have more serious public safety concerns at this time.

We will follow up with DPW in the near future and let you know what possible improvements can be applied to this issue.

Thank you.

""While we do have some limited MOST funding for stormwater projects, we have already allocated the most recent funding to projects that were in the queue quite a long time ago, and are still addressing issues that have a more severe impact to the drainage and protection of the roadways.  We did have our team has inspect the drainage inlets in the same area and did find some that needed cleaning, so we then referred this work to our DWM crews to have the structures cleaned out. 

In spite of our efforts to clean the stormwater basins along this area, we believe that this matter is better addressed by the City’s Dept. of Public Works (DPW), to help address roadway paving options that can better help to drain this specific area.  Installation of new stormwater inlets and pipes would for this one area would be very costly and not the most effective use of the limited funding we have available.

We will remind DPW about this issue and see if they can directly respond as to their options and schedule to assist in resolving this matter.""

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4246649,"One time a guy robbed another guy outside the liquor store at the corner of Semmes and Washington Road.  He then ran down Semmes street and ran left onto this section of Westwood, with the police not too far behind.  He ran behind this house in question on this posting, and disappeared.  

There were more cop cars than you could imagine within about 10 minutes.  They canvassed the area, and finally determined the guy had run into this house.

They surrounded the house and yelled at him with a megaphone to come out.  Then they waited.  Finally, they gave up and left.

I asked one of the officers why didn't they just go in the house and get the guy, and I was told the house was unsafe for officers to go into, that the flooring was rotted out in some places, and he didn't want to risk his officers safety pursuing this subject into such a property.

That was several years ago.

The police are the code enforcement in East Point.  And yet to date nothing has been done.

Here is my prediction:  nothing is going to get done this time either.",2018-05-11T15:33:59-04:00,2018-05-11T15:33:59-04:00,1436058,JPfromthePoint,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4095879,"I was a part of the initiative to put the stop sign in at Beatty. And have been a part of several traffic calming meetings. As I’m not sure who this is, I don’t want to offend. But as one who lives at that intersection, I must say that the traffic has been better since that hump was removed. We have been seeing less hostile driving and less speeding around to pass on the left. Most city planners will tell you that adding speed bumps, especially as severe as that one was, can in fact create more hostile driving. At any rate, it’s a discussion to be had as part of a larger initiative for Second Ave. ",2018-02-05T10:28:12-05:00,2018-02-05T10:28:12-05:00,1337403,Kathryn Johnson,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4095879,"Kathryn, perhaps better at your location on 2nd, however, what it has done towards Oakview is made it very difficult to even get out of one's driveway during peak traffic, not to mention the much higher speeds attained by the commuters(it's all down hill from Oakview towards Beatty). In addition to the stop sign at the intersection of Beatty and 2nd, there is a speed bump two houses towards East Lake which keeps traffic very slow on that portion of 2nd, even though the stop sign attenuates the issue in that location.
I recall signing your petition for the stop sign after the near fatal situation with the bicyclist who ran the stop sign from Beatty and the irony of that is the bicyclists still don't stop for the stop sign!",2018-02-05T11:04:00-05:00,2018-02-05T11:04:00-05:00,1516476,John Lee,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/4095879,"Kathryn Johnson:  I support the stop sign but like John said beyond the intersection people hit the gas and speed unabated from Oakview to the stop sign and from the stop sign to Oakview.  There needs to be something that mitigates speeding along that stretch because it is a safety issue with so many children on the sidewalks on this block.  This isn't an either/or situation and there are two speed humps on the other side of the Beatty intersection on 2nd.

I love plants but it is a safety issue that we cannot see past the large Oakleaf Hydrangea which is compounded by the less than 45* angle of Howard to Lansdowne. I know I have to pull the front of my car out into Howard on coming traffic to see. It's kind of nerve wrecking!

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3742097,"I hope these stripes are *never* applied. 
It is not at all clear, that is, what *safety* purpose they would serve.

When cities double-yellow neighborhood streets like this they send the following message: drivers should treat this road as if it is a highway. This is where these double-yellow lines belong -- highways.
Neighborhood streets should receive as little striping and as few signs as possible.

Study after study (not that anyone cares about facts) have shown that the *fewer* the road treatments applied, the safer the street. It does sound counter-intuitive. The lack of striping affects driving behavior toward the more-cautious, which should always be the goal.",2017-10-01T13:59:41-04:00,2017-10-01T13:59:41-04:00,153811,BarryHall,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3734254,"Agree. This is an enormous public safet issue. It is a hazard for traffic that must swerve around them in a location near a street crossing that makes it a pedestrian hazard. Many of the pedestrians are from the hospital clinic, many are diasabled on motorized scooters. Still more pedestrians cross this section of the street midblick as jaywalkers going to the housing authority and the Kroger. 

This was a poor architecture decision in the 1960s to allow super block buildings that were allowed to build tall and right up to the property line without setbacks allowing for on-site deliveries on a surface lot. This zone is a hazardous set of issues that on-street loading only makes worse. 

The answer is for the upper deck parking garage to be 'sliced back' ( the lid taken off the ground level service drop off that exists) so that trucks can not have a clearance problem ) .These office buildings are commercial ventures, they should be made to keep their functions so they don't cause safety hazards, and loaded no is a cost of doing business.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3734254,"Jaywalking and scootering is a separate issue, also needing an ordinance and enforcement.  There are 3 chronic jaywalking sites in this area: Commerce between medical buildings and Kroger, Commerce between Baptist parking and offices on Church corner, and Church between state services buildings and Bank of America Lot.  I have seen many people jaywalking less than 20' from a corner and marked crosswalk. The scooters move fast and are a special hazard.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3734254,"It's a phased solution. The jaywalking should ultimately be addressed (like it is in urban centers around the US, and in Improvement Districts like Midtown, Buckhead etc) with railings, street furniture and tree skirt fences along the sidewalk as required installations for the redevelopment projects that will occur along these linear blocks. This prevents random movements into the moving traffic lanes. In the interim, an education program must be developed for the area businesses (housing authority, DeKalb Medical, County parole office) to post signs and encourage reformed behaviors of their clients. And law enforcement starts with community policing and education too. Law enforcement needs input on what works best and how to get it done. But it needs to start sometime soon, it's a worsening problem and injuries are imminent ",2017-09-27T10:07:39-04:00,2017-09-27T10:07:39-04:00,1219155,Jeff Johnson,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the issue with SR # 1119835460 has nothing to do with a missing pipe lid. The pipe sits too low in the ground. Rather than cars driving on top of the pipe, it too far down in the hole and the cars are just hitting a massive square cut out in the middle of the road at speed. Rather than replacing a lid, which will not accomplish anything to help the issue, is it possible to have the pipe fixed to sit flush with the rest of the road?

Perhaps, Mr. Floyd, you can answer my question.  I am one of the people trying to increase neighborhood involvement in the Great Lakes area.  It is not really possible to organize a neighborhood work day for families when there is lots of poison ivy, and problems involving the stability of the deck, safety of trees, and no clear idea of our responsibility.
Could you (or point me to the person who could) please outline  for the Great Lakes Neighborhood association what the City of Decatur's responsibilities are in the upkeep of Waddell park, and what part is  the neighborhood's responsibility?  I have been looking for the answer to this question for some time, without success, and so would appreciate your looking into it, or letting me know where I can look for an answer.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3668108,"This is good to hear!  Can we utilize the new Dunwoody Citizen Patrol to provide warnings to those parking illegally or using our driveways as turn arounds?  The past couple of years, once people got a few tickets, everyone tended to park away from the intersection on their own (but still had the occasional violator). 

For the bushes at 2262 Brookhurst, I see that GDOT's manuals suggest that a driver with eye height 3.5' feet above the ground should be able to see a car 390' away (both to the left and right) at 15' back from the curb, for a 2-lane road with a 35mph speed limit.  We can't even see 10 feet.  If these bushes can't be maintained by the homeowner at 3.5', then they need to be moved or removed.  Kids having to walk between cars that are forced to ease into the intersection just to see is dangerous and some of these kids are short enough to ""disappear"".  I think children's safety should outweigh an individual's right to obstruct sight distance.  If this were a fence, these heights would never be allowed.

This time you are paving Winship, which is also in my neighborhood and was in basically perfect shape by comparison to my road, Kenbrook Drive. How do I get my road repaved? Beyond just being ugly, the crumbled pieces are a walking hazard and not great for car tires. Thank you.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3337969,"Actually, the bikes have been there for YEARS. I've lived on Adair for 11 years and for the first month I lived here, I thought the Mormons were visiting him.  I think the real solution to this problem is to change the ""no parking"" from the east side of the street to the West side of the street.  This serves two needs: 1. the homeowner no longer has to worry about people trampling on his yard/garden or parking in front of his house and 2. it allows those visiting Adair Park to park on the same side of the street as the park (where there's a sidewalk -- there isn't a sidewalk on the West side of Adair whereas there is a sidewalk on the East side.)  This would be SO MUCH SAFER for parents and their children.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/3230219,"I don't understand the response.  You are ""working to organize the work and get everything scheduled to be completed"".  Does this mean you are scheduling people to actual sweep the bike lanes?  If that is the case, what are you doing to ensure that the construction companies actually keep them clean?  The rocks did not spring out of the roadway like Athena came from Zeus or mushrooms appear after a rain.  If you don't make the workers clean up at the end of the day - do a sweep of the paths and remove the rocks - it will get full again.  Or, are you talking about some other work that is getting done.  Please help me understand what is actually happening - I thought that this is what this app was all about. 

I've worked on all kinds of projects similar to this - and at the end of the day - 10 minutes before we leave - we always had to clean up the site and the surrounding area.  How hard is it for the construction companies to do this.  How hard is it to keep their debris out of the stupid lanes - I have to choose to either be potentially hit by a car or navigate through tons of rocks to stay safe.  Seriously, 5 minutes at the end of the day and a broom solves this problem.  ",2017-05-15T09:33:34-04:00,2017-05-15T09:33:34-04:00,1419570,Stu,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subject: SCF request from resident

Good Morning Dan,

This is the information for the resident who sent a request on SeeClickFix and was very unhappy that she didn?t get a response.  I had told you I would send you the information so you can respond/close the ticket on SCF.  She had left several follow up comments along with her original SCF request, which weren't seen by anybody.  It might be helpful to let her know that that's why she wasn't getting a response.

I had tried to send an email response to her, but it came back undeliverable.  I also left her a VM message to give her an update.

        Lake Forrest is a secondary route and is on the schedule to be mowed this week, weather permitting.
        We have requested that Michael Barnett have landscapers trim back the vegetation on the wall (see attached picture),
                to ensure they are manicured property

The resident is Harriet Smith, the Lucity is 16-045066.

Thanks,

Good Morning Michael,

The vegetation on the wall on Lake Forrest, near Cameron Manor, needs to be trimmed.  Given the history of this vegetation, Donald has requested that professional landscapers trim it back.  Please let me know who I should send this to, if you are not the right person.

Thanks!

Subject: Request for Mowing

Good Morning Ms. Smith,

This is in response to your request for mowing on Lake Forrest Drive.  I apologize that you have had difficulty getting a response.   We do strive to provide quality customer service to our residents, so I will look into what caused the delay and make sure we improve our response time in the future.  

Lake Forrest Drive is on our list of secondary routes, which means it gets mowed 4 times during the growing season.  The last time it was mowed was on July 1st.  The 3rd phase of mowing started last week, and I have confirmed that Lake Forrest Drive is on the schedule to be mowed this week, weather permitting.  I will have one of our Field Superintendents follow up, to make sure it was completed.   Just to let you know, the 4th phase of mowing will be in October. 

Please feel free to contact me with any additional questions or concerns.  

Thank you, 

Cheryl Oslund

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/2742201,"What needs to be verified is if the animal waste produced by the dogs the owner is ""petsitting"" or ""kennelling"" is flowing into Peachtree Creek behind the house during rainfall. 

Interestingly, at the intersection of Geneva/Lucerne/Champlain, Dekalb County has posted a yellow sign reporting a sewage spill. The property at 311 Willow runs downhill towards the Peachtree Creek. The residences on the other side back up to the creek where the sign is posted. If numerous dogs are kenneled here at 311 Willow, especially during weekends/holidays, how can the owner control where dog waste goes? If it smells like dog waste when walking past the property, then surely there is dog waste flowing to the creek when it rains. This is disgusting and unsafe for our environment, especially our creeks feeding into public parks where children wade barefoot during warm weather.

I think this warrants a full investigation on how the owner is using his property at 311 Willow Lane. Please take the time to walk in front of this property. Would you live next to this house?",2016-09-27T09:01:44-04:00,2016-09-27T09:01:44-04:00,1349090,HEIDI K OSHEA,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/2498996,"Mr. Maximuk, As someone who has lived on Norris Street for over thirty five years, may I suggest that the problem is not that the road is poorly maintained.  The road, a one lane dirt/gravel ""turkey path"" (Mr. Clyde Davidson's description, who lived on the corner of Norris and Church for more than fifty years) that is the last remaining Civil War era street in Decatur, was not designed to handle the hundreds of soccer mommies and daddies that choke the road on the weekends. May I suggest that you either designate the road ""residents only"" during the weekend, forcing soccer parents to walk the 100 yards from Church Street parking spaces or what I favor, which is ""Do Nothing"".  The condition of the road forces people to slow down thereby making the park safer for walking children and their parents.  Drivers do a pretty good job navigating the road without the help of the police or other government workers.  Oh, one more thing, the tree trunk in the middle of the end of road parking lot is all that remains of the keep to the right swing around that helped vehicles move through the area.  Why the city cut it down is beyond my level of comprehension but that's another topic.

Subject: Report of Water Leak and Broken Sidewalk on Roswell Road

Good Afternoon,    

This is in response to your report of the water leak and the broken sidewalk on Roswell Road.   The address that came through for the water leak on SeeClickFix does not match the picture of the leak, so I just want to confirm that the leak is near the BB&T Bank.  

With regards to the sidewalk, because there is a water leak at this location, we cannot repair the sidewalk until the leak has been repaired.  With that said, the City of Atlanta (COA) has jurisdiction for the water infrastructure in the City of Sandy Springs.   We have reported both of these water leaks to the City of Atlanta. 

In the event that you would like to report these leaks as well, below is the contact information for reporting water meter leaks to the City of Atlanta.   When reporting the leak, be sure to get a ticket number and to reference this number each time you contact COA about the leak.   

 To report a leaking or damaged water meter, please call the Department of Watershed Management Customer Service at 404-546-0311, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Following  is the link to the City of Atlanta website, regarding report of leaking or broken water meters:  http://www.atl311.com/?page_id=115&atlId=1-4NTBC&_crauth=85ac1e5a03

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.   

Thank you,

I have to think that's baloney. 

This week, the lights are more random than ever. It is IMPOSSIBLE to go through two consecutive SB lights. NB, one day you can make a couple; another day you can't make anything. 

And now even the light at the former Hickory House is red for CDR at flipping 4:30 in the morning. Really?

Much of America flashes lights in the wee hours.

I have had a many-message back and forth with them about this. What they told me was this crossing was ""being studied"" for a more-advanced type pedestrian crossing with some sort of signal. This is the reason, I think, that there are now auto stop lines at an intersection with no signal. Also, they, very eventually, removed old signage from East Lake that directed cars into the southbound bike lane. 

There are also 'No Parking' signs along Park Ave. adjacent a very obvious, newly striped parking lane. These, I assume, will be removed when the new pedestrian signal goes in. Or not.",2016-02-21T21:48:08-05:00,2016-02-21T21:48:08-05:00,153811,BarryHall,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/2133143,"Difficult to understand a safety issue here. 
Stopped motor traffic at Olympic should *cautiously* and safely enter the intersection at College when school children are present. Unless, of course, motorists have something better to do than operate their 3,000-pound conveyance in a safe and cautious manner. I am sure that is not you, however. Always vigilant and always cautious, surely.
To be clear: roadway traffic signals are a *safety* device not a license to drive as if others are simply “in the way” or in need of containment. The first safety device is the operator. Caution, that is, is always an option.

Also, crosswalk signals should be at about the bottom of city roadway priorities. It would be difficult to find any study showing added safety via crosswalk signals.

p.s. I regularly use this crosswalk and have noticed exactly zero danger being posed by those a-foot. The deadly danger posed by motorists, however, is imminent and inescapable.",2016-01-05T10:22:05-05:00,2016-01-05T10:22:05-05:00,153811,BarryHall,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/2133143,"I would encourage you to look more closely at what happens at this particular intersection: while motorists who live on Olympic do understand what limited visibility we have coming off the street and do use caution, the motorists who are too impatient to wait for the left turn onto Atlanta Ave from College, turn into Olympic, turn around and wait in the shorter queue to travel across the tracks do not. Additionally, pedestrians fail to take into consideration that they need to stop when the lights for College AND Olympic are red because there is occasional thru traffic that crosses the tracks on Atlanta Ave and travels onto Olympic; these motorists also have limited visibility if a pedestrian has just stepped into the crosswalk as they are coming through the intersection and continuing on Olympic. 

I flagged this as a safety issue because the traffic patterns at this particular intersection are confusing to those adults not familiar with the intersection and totally baffling to children who use that crosswalk without so much as a glance across the tracks to confirm the absence of oncoming cars to Olympic! 

John Maximuk has been on Olympic and observed the dangers posed by this intersection first hand. The residents of Olympic are encouraged by the involvement of the City, but we hope to keep the issue at the forefront of the City to ensure pedestrian safety at this particular intersection.

Yes drivers should be careful nobody is suggesting otherwise, but I think that misses the fundamental point that a 5 way intersection that is designated as a safe route to school for multiple surrounding schools, on a busy state road, should reasonably at a minimum have walk signals in all cross walks.

Subject: See Click Fix Trash Complaint

Hey Cheryl,

We got a See Click Fix complaint (Lucity Ticket 15-072959) for 410 Lafayette Court, would PW be able to pick this up since it is in the street? We are not quite able to pinpoint who left the trash there and can?t really serve a notice. Let me know either way. &#61514;

So may I suggest, the city replace the trees with an appropriate tree that will not impact the line of sight.
 You have my permission to remove them completely and plant something more appropriate than a 60/70 foot tree.
Yes, Gerry, the developer here got away with lots of things that should not have been able to do.
Especially planting inappropriate trees in inappropriate places.

Good Afternoon Ms. Smith,

This is in response to your request to mow and pick up the litter on Lake Forrest between Hammond and Lancaster.   While this road is on the schedule to be mowed 4 times a growing season,  I have issued a work order for our contractors to put it in their schedule for this week.   

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.    

Thank you,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1478842,"I received this message posted today on the Nextdoor Morningside/Lenox Park forum.

Many drivers are confused and don't know what to do at HAWK pedestrian signals.   How will they be educated?   Please see the posting below:
 	
<Neighbor>, Morningside/Lenox Park

I've called and written the DOT with no response except that they ""don't have enough information."" When the cross light for pedestrians near Monroe and Piedmont turns solid red, obviously one must stop for the pedestrian who needs to cross. Then the light starts flashing red. It's red, so I think red means stop and I wait until it has completely turned off before driving on. I am frustrating drivers behind me who honk if the flashing signal starts and I continue to sit there as I do. I in turn feel frustrated by the drivers who start driving despite the flashing red.
I don't know what the lawful thing to do is. Here is the link to the GA traffic laws regarding traffic signals.
http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010...
In this section of the code, a steady red signal is referenced, as is a red arrow, but no mention can I find of a flashing red signal.
I ran into another flashing red signal today at Mt. Paran and Lake Forrest. It's a 4 way stop and there is a constant red flashing signal in all four directions. I assumed that is to point out to people that it is a 4 way STOP and they are to respect the STOP sign. As in 4 way stops, traffic stops for the stop sign and go in turn, so they are driving through the flashing red signal.
Anyone know what to do?
Thanks,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1388286,"Service request 179941111 has been closed and it has been determined that a left turn signal is not warranted at the intersection of Moreland and Hardee ST for the northbound or southbound direction. This request was made earlier this year, with a count and study performed in late January 2017 and again this month. An inspection of the intervals in the AM and PM peak hours show no increase in southbound or northbound turn volumes. The current volume of turns at this intersection along with the low crash rate are sufficiently below the levels of warranting a turn signal light at this intersection.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1368834,"Hi, it's been about six weeks now and I haven't seen any updates to this issue.  Was just checking in on any progress that may have been made towards the trimming of some of these problems limbs and trees.  I basically avoid this route after rains - the imbalance of nearly every tree (intended limbs over the street and heavy cutback on the property side) through this section is easy to see.  Hope someone is on this job - it would appear to be only a matter of time before someone gets hurt if nothing is done until these transitional lots/rebuild sites are under development.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1338166,Agree with the racing down Oaklawn Ave -- but No legal left hand turn has NOT deterred traffic traveling Apple Valley Road and cutting across Oaklawn Ave and Sunland to Caldwell and turning left on Caldwell.

Naturally the county planning people knew best-- without consulting the neighborhood.

Brookhaven police don't care-- they sit right there- or better yet sit in J Cristopher's drinking coffee-- and do nothing to enforce this area.

I appreciate Mr. Walker providing clarifying information regarding this property. He describes this as a non-residential parcel owned by DeKalb County. More than likely, it is the result of tree work from their own crews. I will be glad to have our Public Works Department reach out to them to find out when they plan to dispose of the debris.

The signs that you speak of are not readily visible and only the eastbound side has one sign that is not close enough to the speed bump.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1277602,"I concur that these new speed humps are improperly installed. Its not just Woodrow Way. Drive on Hermance and you will see that Whatever pavement company Brookhaven hired also installed a couple of  improperly designed steep new ones in addition to keeping most of the existing properly designed (By Dekalb Stree Dept) ones.It is quite the contrast. The original ones (dozens are located throughout Brookhaven and neighboring communities)work great forcing drivers to keep speed within posted limit. The new ones are too high and steep forcing drivers to almost stop or buck them out of seats. the speed limit is 25 MPH. 
There is no reason to force cars to slow to 10MPH or stop  on Woodrow Way as there are no crosswalks in the area of speed humps. In fact their is a sidewalk with a generous buffer between it and the street on one side and a fenced property of Oglethorpe U on the other side. There is nothing to cross over to.
I also am concerned that these will delay Emergency vehicles responding to calls to my neighborhood. Minutes and seconds can make a difference.",2014-09-10T16:23:56-04:00,2014-09-10T16:23:56-04:00,570320,M Peters,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1277602,I am complaining because the original speed humps worked perfectly. The new ones were installed by a lowest bid subcontractor hired by our new City Government. I am concerned that this shoddy workmanship will carry over to other Public Works projects. The street is not a private subdivision but a public street that feeds multiple neighborhoods. Its a direct route for Emergency vehicles to these neighborhoods also. I was at the original county meeting years ago when theses speed humps were proposed and the public was assured that these would be of the type that would allow ingress/egress at posted speed of 25 mph and not require a stop and roll. Look at all the other original properly installed ones on Hermance and Lanier drive.They work perfectly to curtail excessive speed yet allow smooth travel. I don't like to see our tax money wasted on shoddy workmanship. The company should be forced to redo the speed humps..,2014-09-10T16:52:24-04:00,2014-09-10T16:52:24-04:00,318574,tomc45,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1190587,"Jimmie, I also appreciate their landscaping and the work they put into it.  Just because it is different and may not be their choice in plants I don’t understand complaining about it.  These want-a-bees that get all in your business over trivial issues really detract from the appeal of the area.  Just look at the number of votes this issue had received.

You know, it was our district one city council person that disliked what these people were doing to their own property and made the first complaint about this yard last year via SCF to code enforcement.  Disappointingly, there were several others that piled on with her in agreement with their own comments.  This tells you about the people living in this neighborhood and one of our city council members.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1190587,"Being the “nicest family you could ever meet” does not exempt a homeowner from abiding by the City’s code. Either their hardscape and plants are in the right of way or they are not. The City or County Fire Department can determine if the homeowner is encroaching or not. Facts dictate not how nice they are or what type of plants they enjoy. 
Is this the same nice family that also had their rear construction stopped for not having a building permit? Should they be given special building privileges as well?

And yes, the community as a whole is harmed when entire front lawns are paved, excessive numbers of commercial vans are parked on residential property, and planters are on sidewalks which are designed for walkers, joggers, bikers and people in wheelchairs.
 
If one doesn't wish to live by the City Code they should file for a variance or move to a community that has Ordinances they can live by.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1190587,"The discussion is not about what they were building onto the back of their house - stay on track with the issue of their plants being in the right of way.  

A person has to be pretty fat or have a super wide stroller/wheelchair if they cannot get by this yard.

The plants and trees are not in the right of way - they are contained within their yard - the only true problem is they planted 2-4 plants too close to the fire hydrant.  

If you think this yard hurts our neighborhood - look up and down all of our streets - there are LOTS of grass, plants, trees, flowers, roses, etc. planted up to the sidewalk edge, including my yard - I have plants around my mailbox, in the strip between the street and sidewalk and my trees canopy 8 feet over the sidewalk.  Should they all be cut down - what a major hit our neighborhood would take and how barren it would be.

As previously stated, the ""city"" has a right to take a certain amount of our yards but we are fully expected to maintain it.  How about we all stop doing that, rake it all clean and pour concrete or dump gravel - it's the city's property - let them take care of it.  I've thought about doing that many times over the years.  

In my opinion, it seems that you are basing your issue based on what they were trying to do in their backyard which has already been handled because I cannot fathom why someone is so concerned about a brick touching the sidewalk.  

As far as everyone being harmed - what happens when the city allows the clear cutting of all trees - incuding specimen trees, grass, shrubs, flowers?  That is a huge hit to our community - I'd be more concerned about that in the big scheme of things.  

Regardless, I will let their gardener know about the bricks and the plants hiding the fire hydrant the next time I see them.

Can you insert a link specific to residential landscaping - I could not find anything on the City of Brookhaven site that specifically discusses what to do when I want to make changes to my yard - plant trees, shrubs, flowers, etc..

If you are referring to building that was going on attached to the back of the house - stay on point - that was stopped long ago - certainally you already know that, so we do not know what improvements they were going to make.  
This is about their bricks being barely an inch onto the sidewalk and a few plants around the fire hydrant which is clearly visible and not covered in dirt - I am going by there Thursday on my way to the park, I will let them know the hydrant needs the plants and bricks removed from around it because the fire department may not see it in the dark and it should be kept clearly visible - a really easy task to accomplish.

You will see it cycle through even if someone is not at that spot but that is by design. Look at the signal after it counting down at crosswalk and you will see the sequence. 

I drive that twice a day and I find that once I get a green it saves a lot of time. It's one red light that adds 30 - 60 seconds to a commute...

·         The Perimeter Summit intersection is scheduled to be repaired later this month along with the striping changes.
 
·         The Lake Hearn intersection has poor detection and is placing false calls. This intersection is planned to be upgraded as part of the PCID’s Automated Traffic Management System (ATMS) project in the future. The signal is working on a pre-timed plan and not activated by an arriving car.

The previous home was set much lower on the site, and it also appears the builder built up even the ground level with a mountain of dirt, so the threshold of the first floor is much higher than the previous home on the lot.

- Brookhaven has taken on the responsibility of creating statutes intended to reflect the will and desire of the residents and then enforcing those statutes.

- It's questionable if the current statutes are proper and it's questionable if they are being properly enforced.

Although this forum is not about the statutes themselves, it is definitely about enforcement. Brookhaven has not done a very good job when it comes to enforcement. The enforcement is inconsistent and often comes too late - or is too lenient.

Brookhaven does not have sufficient resources to properly enforce compliance. Brookhaven also does not have sufficient training in place to provide consistent and proper compliance.

The city appears to have outsourced much of their services and these problems are likely related to this cost-cutting approach to service.

Can you tell me if that residence has pulled a home based business permit and is allowed to park vehicles for that business in the driveway?  Please provide the business license number issued by the city.  

Can you tell me if and when a building permit was pulled for any of this work and if it was approved by the city? Also provide what this permit was for and if it is still open. Please provide building permit number and the specifics of the permit.  Hint:  there was one pulled

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1135200,"Alan and Bubba,

First of all I am not a ""NO BROOKHAVEN"" person.  I do however, now that the city exists, feel it adds no value as do a majority of people in the city. I actually voted for the city.  But thanks for the arrogance. We have a police department and very questionable leadership.  Thats about it. So congrats to us.

As far as wasting tax dollars, I will explain it to you.  The city has very limited resources and funds because of not only the way it was set up in regards to taxation but also in regards to staff that it can afford in correlation with the taxation.  The code enforcement that we have does not need to be taking hours of their day to read ridiculous claims on the internet, let alone spend countless hours to follow up and make on site visits to appease uninformed residents.   But in the end they will do this to satisfy the dumb masses of people who are ignorant to code and building ordinances.  Look on SCF and you will see a ton of things are not worthy of the time it takes to write them.  From this post that has gone on for months or several others where true violations dont exists.  If people are going to complain they need to be educated in the law and not expect the city to chase down every ignorant claim by tax people who hate new growth in District 1.  Which is exactly what this (being the 3 post) and countless others are.  

So when the city can't keep up with worthless claims they hire new people to do it.  This increases the cost of the city to run day to day operations.  We have new salaries, new cars, new office space, etc.  Now you may think that you are ""paying for this"" but what you are actually doing is creating the need for more city income which it will get from the rest of us who aren't complaining about vans in a driveway.

As far as outsourcing:  the cities code enforcement is not outsourced and its run by city employees.  This is a perfect example of how uninformed people have no business on this site. 

There may be a violation here, maybe.  But hounding the city on 3 separate posts is a ridiculous waste of everyones time and is going to cost us all more in the future.  They are looking into it and if there is a violation it will take time to runs its course and to get the proper paperwork, permits, and variance in order.  And I think after the millions spent on the pink pony lawsuit and stardust we could use a little more of the funds to stay around instead of spending it on things with more importance.

""Additionally, PAVING of the front yard is limited to a maximum of 35 percent. A front yard is defined by the Zoning Ordinance as the ""area extending across the total width of a lot between side lot lines and being that area between the street right-of-way lines and that line or lines established by the front wall or walls of the principal structure projected to intersect the side lot lines.""

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1135200,"@ Eric - I'm with you. I believe the determination as to the 35% was already made in the prior service request ID 1076647, but this reporter had follow up questions regarding what specific materials are classified as paving material (which would count towards the 35%). 

Although Code Compliance mentioned pea gravel or any gravel/stone/paver material counts towards the 35% in the prior service request -- the reporter wanted to confirm whether actual cement counts towards the 35%. I get the impression that is the major overall concern -- that there is too much cement material covering the front. 

The other issue at hand is what appears may be new developments regarding the potential operation of a commercial business in a residential area. I'd like to have Code Compliance take a second look, since the last site visit was in June, to investigate further to see if the situation has changed. I am thinking the sign might not have been up at the time of the original site visit. I believe this would have been an indicator of the potential business activities that may be taking place there.

We'll look out for an update from Code Compliance on these issues. Thanks to everyone!

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1116943,"Clarification for Kay Wolfe and all Brookhaven residents regarding city management and ownership of the parks...

As discussed last night at the city council meeting, the parks were supposed to have been purchased, and title transferred from DeKalb long ago.  However, the day before the new city took over the management of the parks last fall, DeKalb signed a long term lease with the group that leases the facility at Brookhaven Park.  Also, DeKalb did not authorize an Environmental study to be performed as required under state law, before a park property can be purchased or transferred.

Once DeKalb ultimately released authorization late in the fall, the environmental studies were performed.  It was discovered that 3 of the parks have possible environmental contamination, making it illegal for the park property to be transferred until the contamination is remediated.  The city wanted to purchase the parks with no contamination and with no long term lease agreements that prevent the city from managing, improving and owning the park property.  However, DeKalb decided to not transfer any parks unless all parks are transferred.

As a result, the city still doesn’t own the parks and can only merely cut the grass and perform other negligible management activities at this time.  Last night it was reported that after performing more extensive environmental work, only 1 of the parks has contamination that might present a hazard to people utilizing the park.  As a result, the city authorized the city attorney and manager to attempt to purchase all the parks, except the one prohibited by the lease agreement, and for the other park with the contamination to parcel out the area with the contamination until it the contamination is remediated.  However, if DeKalb still wants to make the transfer contingent upon the ability to transfer all park properties, the transfer will not take place for some time.

Until title transfer occurs, the city will not own the parks, will not have the ability to improve them except for cutting grass and only negligible management activities.",2014-06-11T16:13:13-04:00,2014-06-11T16:13:13-04:00,220307,Jeff Kellar,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuing to blame DeKalb is simply getting old.  As someone that has worked so hard over the past two years prior to city incorporation I would think you would demand more from our city council and the high priced city manager they continue to support with her deficient job production for our city.",2014-06-11T22:05:43-04:00,2014-06-11T22:05:43-04:00,103888,Rick Ztul,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1116943,"Thanks Rick for your comment.  Based on my experience and first hand knowledge, I don't think anyone, anywhere, could have accomplished this any faster.  One of the primary reasons I worked so hard for 2 years to create the new city, is the dysfunction and corruption of DeKalb.  Rather than ""do the right thing"" and serve constituents, many county employees and some officials prefer to go out of their way (in this case for what they perceive as retribution) to not ""do the right thing"" and serve constituesnts.  

As a result, it is not a surprise when DeKalb refuses to transfer the parks.  Rather than clean up their own house, some people prefer to continue to attempt to bring their dysfuction into our back yard.  An option would be to file suit, but that could possibly only delay the process.  The mayor and council told Marie and legal counsel Tuesday to go back to DeKalb and demand transfer of the parks immediately, with the exception of the parts of Brookhaven Park and Lynwood Park that cannot be transferred at this time because of the lease and environmental contamination.  We will see how they respond.",2014-06-12T16:20:45-04:00,2014-06-12T16:20:45-04:00,220307,Jeff Kellar,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1116943,"Jeff I appreciate your first hand experience with this issue.  You may be too close to the issue, city leaders and management to interpret the history of this issue and how it should actually have been handled by our city representatives.  Yes, in the past ten years DeKalb leadership has gained a reputation for being dysfunctional and corrupt, but in some regards Brookhaven leadership, in its short history, is earning a similar reputation.

Maybe Brookhaven leadership should have used legal action against DeKalb; they seem to excel in being known as the most litigious municipality in the area.  Do you really think continuing to throw stones at DeKalb is a positive contribution to the future of our region of DeKalb County?  I don’t.  What governing body wants to join hands in a future regional governmental program with such a fault finding litigious city governed by vitriolic leaders and leading citizens?

Just for the record, as a Brookhaven resident I deal with DeKalb regularly in several departments professionally and privately as I have always and I find the vast majority of DeKalb employees to be polite and efficient.  This is in spite of their knowing that I am a Brookhaven resident.  I am sorry your business with DeKalb is not as positive.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1116943,"I'd actually hope that the city can just convert the whole park to a dog park instead of some small fenced in area like Brook Run or Piedmont in which too many dogs are crowded together resulting in many fights and a lot of dog poop on the ground.  I used to go to Brook Run but stopped after one very scary time where I was approached by a bull mastiff and all of his buddies as I was leaving with my dog on leash.  I also grew tired of scraping the poop off my shoes after every visit.  This has been my experience with most dog parks - the area is too small and I think it contributes to people being lazy and either not watching their dogs closely or not picking up after them because ""it's a dog park"". We have been going to the Brookhaven Park with our dog for 7 years.  Back when we started going, the park was not safe to walk in alone as there were often homeless, drunk or drugged people hanging out as the park is close to Marta and set back from the street.  I think this is what allowed the ""dog people"" to take over as no one else used this park, however this also really helped clean up the park and it no longer seems like an unsafe place.  I would never have ventured over there with my 2 year old before the dogs took over.  It was too scary and there really isn't any playground equipment. 

I also wanted to point out that I actually think this park is a ""gem"" and closing it down or segregating off a small portion for dogs would be a detriment to the city. We know so many people that have moved to Brookhaven because of this park and we ourselves have mentioned that we wouldn't leave Brookhaven because of this park.  We also know many people that drive from other areas to use the park and then shop at City Dog Market, gas stations, grocery stores, etc. It's also become a community where we have seen multiple couples meet and marry, people make best friends or simply just get some time to play frisbee with their dog after a long day.  

We have a very active dog who unfortunately is not fulfilled with an on leash walk.  I wish he was because it would make our lives so much easier, but we adopted him and we need to take care of him and his needs. As a dog owner, I know I am not in the minority in Brookhaven where it seems like almost everyone owns a dog and everyone enjoys spending time with their dog. I really hope the city considers both sides of this issue.",2014-08-23T14:38:31-04:00,2014-08-23T14:38:31-04:00,102799,Brookhaven runner,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ""landscaping"" of the rental home there has spilled out into the roadway, making the roadway very narrow (been this way for YEARS).

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1055380,"I completely agree and shares this before with some others what are involved in the road. 

I don't think cones are the right answer but once the turn lane actually begins ( not at freeway exit ). The plastic dividers that we see to divide lanes throughout the area are what is needed. They mount to the pavement with a base and they should be added at the office park and the second perimeter summit street. 

I too agree I get so annoyed by people doing this again and again which just causes more gridlock. 

Granted ashford dunwoody and Johnson ferry by the gas station could use some is the same dividers. 

Now if I had my magical wand , dunwoody would add the same to AD at the 285 entrance for those that clog up cutting people off with the one lane that enters on the best big side.

I read something that you might want to try. Since it's Sunday it may be a while before the city can respond. 

Cleaning Wet Paint Spills

It is much easier to clean up fresh, wet paint. Speed is the key here. As soon as you spill paint on concrete, act immediately. Whether it is water- or oil-based, first absorb as much as possible. If you're outside, use dirt. Cat litter, sand and potting soil work as well. If it's just a few drips, quickly rubbing a little dirt into it may be all that is needed. For larger spills, sweep the absorbent material and paint mix up, and use the appropriate solvent to clean the area. Using a hose and a stiff bristled brush is effective for water-based paint.",2014-03-15T10:16:14-04:00,2014-03-15T10:16:14-04:00,,KJM,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/852250,"Just wanted to add a few pictures to show the issue a little better. These were taken from our driveway at 1004 Brookhaven Walk NE. You can see how the street turns into a semi river during rain and how the storm drain on our side of the street doesn't even seem to be taking all of the water (even though this was not a very heavy downpour)(see red circle in picture) this worries me for the homes further down Brookhaven Walk, in case of a very significant rainfall for a lengthy period of time. The main issue here has been present for a while and it is the fact that during a storm you can follow the water flow from the top of Osborne (by Peachtree), it flows down Osborne on the right hand side of the road and then exactly by the upper Brookhaven Walk entrance it crosses over and rushes down our street. The only solutions I can think of would be to have a drain put in that stretches across our street as Pelly Circle NE has it (one neighborhood over) or to somehow change the way Osborne Road's bend makes the water flow down here.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,This signal is being timed as part of the PTOP program.  The consultant doing the timing work for PTOP has looked at this intersection and there is not much from a timing issue that they can do to help W Nancy Creek.  The issue is the volume of traffic on Ashford Dunwoody.  Giving more time to W Nancy will just back up A-D more which wont help relieve W Nancy.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"@Richard Meehan.   With all due respect the consultant is wrong.    There is a very long timing cycle between greens for West Nancy Creek Traffic at Ashford Dunwoody.   And the Ashford Dunwoody traffic does not get backed up at this light.  During peak traffic periods the Northbound Ashford Dunwoody traffic is getting backed up North of Ashford Dunwoody because of the 285/Lake Hearn/Perimeter Center limits.     And of course the Southbound traffic is backed up at the Johnson Ferry Intersection where its been pointed out by many that they need to restripe the road and perhaps put in plastic lane divider tubes to sort out the traffic going straight vs. the limited traffic going right(west/ north/west).

So reducing the wait between green light cycles for West Nancy Creek would not negatively impact traffic movement n Ashford Dunwoody.   ",2013-12-13T11:50:25-05:00,2013-12-13T11:50:25-05:00,,Eric Hovdesven,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

IN the meantime, I will get with the PTOP consultant again to re-look at the signal, but based on my observations, the backup is mostly because of traffic congestion on Ashford Dunwoody.  It also is not backing up every day.  I drove through on West Nancy Creek from Johnson Ferry to Ashford Dunwoody yesterday a little before 6:00 and there was no backup at all and I got through the light at Ashford Dunwoody on the first cycle.  I also observed that the 5 or 6 vehicles in front of me, as well as a long line behind me were all ""cut through"" vehicles going from Johnson Ferry through to Ashford Dunwoody.  Not a single one of the vehicles I could see turned into or came from any of the driveways or the side roads along either Old Johnson Ferry or West Nancy Creek.  When we are able to make improvements to the intersection, it is likely to make this cut through problem worse, not better.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"@Richard we aren't all making it up and its not due to congestion on Ashford Dunwoody.  The problem isn't people not being able to turn onto Ashford Dunwoody Road, the problem is the light signalization is far to short for the number of cars.   

Though your point is well taken about increasing cut through which is why I would object to turn lanes or other capacity enhancements.     

However as it stands now, the congestion at that intersection is on West Nancy Creek not on Ashford Dunwoody.  The timing cycle is far to long between Greens.   Can you tell me how long the Green cycles are and how long it stays Green for West Nancy Creek?  

Also since you have noted your observation of traffic on West Nancy Creek, what is your observation of Ashford Dunwoody at that intersection?   Do you agree with my contention that the back up is not caused by that intersection but the intersections north and south of West Nancy Creek on Ashford Dunwoody and therefore reducing the time between green lights for West Nancy Creek wouldn't make matters much worse on Ashford Dunwoody?

One of the measurements appears to be related to time stopped at lights.   Which may suggest the reason for the poorly timed light.   While it doesn't necessarily improve overall traffic flow through the entire Ashford Dunwoody Corridor inside 285 it keeping the West Nancy timed for underperforming Green Light time reduces the number of times cars on Ashford Dunwoody have to stop at this intersection.   Which is a hollow victory since even though they stop less at this intersection it just doesn't improve their overall trip time since they will face the bottlenecks further down or up Ashford Dunwoody.    ,2013-12-18T11:58:58-05:00,2013-12-18T11:58:58-05:00,,guest1,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"I will get the information on the cycle times and splits from the consultant and post them here as soon as I can.

Eric - regarding my observations of Ashford Dunwoody flow in the PM, from what I have seen, all of the intersections, including W Nancy Creek and Harts MIll, backup traffic to some degree.  How much each intersection does, and how much the backup from one intersection ""bleeds"": into the one preceding it depends on the volume on Ashford Dunwoody in a particular day.  This volume can vary significantly based on several factors including is there soccer at the YMCA that afternoon, does Marist have a special event/afternoon sports activity, how bad in the congestion on I-285.  This last one probably has the biggest impact.  On days I-285 is heavily congested, more vehicles will divert to Ashford Dunwoody.  On those days, I would expect that there is also higher ""cut through"" traffic from Johnson Ferry on W Nancy which makes that backup worse as well.  One of the things the PTOP program is looking at in the coming year is the possibility of implementing ""Traffic Responsive"" or ""Traffic Adaptive"" timing.  Without getting to much into the technical details here, these systems basically will use a computer algorithm to dynamically adjust the signal timings based on traffic volumes on a given day.  Right now, the signal timing is based on ""Time of Day"" plans that were developed and adjusted using ""average"" volumes for a particular time period.  Under this system, the signal will call the same timing plan at the same time everyday, regardless of the volumes on that particular day.  To get to the ability to use either Traffic Responsive or Traffic Adaptive, there will need to be an upgrade of the signal equipment, specifically the computers, detectors, and the communications between signals.  We have applied for a grant to the Atlanta Regional Commission for the funding to do these upgrades and we should here about that soon after the New Year.

JG - regarding the Marist/Harts Mill light, as you mentioned, that signal does have Left Turn arrows and Left Turn lanes for the side roads.  Besides the differences in volumes from those roads from W Nancy Creek, that is the biggest reason why that signal operates ""more smoothly"" for the drivers on Harts Mill and Marist.  At W Nancy Creek, one car attempting to turn left on Ashford Dunwoody can block all other cars from going through the intersection.  So even if there is green time for say 15-20 cars on a particular cycle, if the first or second car is turning left and has to wait for opposing traffic, you may only have 3 or 4 cars get through on that cycle which will further back up traffic on W Nancy.  Since there are no Left Turn Lanes on W Nancy Creek, adding Left Turn Arrows for W Nancy will not improve the flow on that road.  With turn arrows and no turn lanes, if the first car or 2 is going straight or right, they will block the left turners from proceeding on the arrow resulting in the same problem.  The standards that the City must follow require that for a turn arrow phase to be installed, there must be a dedicated turn lane.  

Adding left (and/or right) turn lanes on the W Nancy Creek at this intersection and subsequently adding the appropriate turn arrows if needed is ONE possible solution to this intersection that will be looked at. But as with any other solution, it will need to be studied and fully vetted with the community, through both the CTP process and any subsequent improvement plan development before it is implemented.

Finally, we are aware of and we do read all the comments posted and we are trying to respond to them as quickly as we can,  However, depending on our schedule here and what other issues we are dealing with, it can occasionally take us some time to post a formal response to questions.  We are very aware of the issue here and very much want to work with the community to develop a workable solution.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Thanks Richard.   Looking forward to the timing information on the Marist and West Nancy intersections    Until adaptive is in place they do need to give a little more time for West Nancy Creek,  285 congestion does seem to cause more problems for West Nancy than Ashford Dunwoody since Ashford Dunwoody doesn't have that lack of turn lane issue you identified.    

Teresa raises a good point.   Putting in lights at AD and West Nancy with turn signals and having the East side and West side turn green at different times would address the problem of the cars that are trying to turn left clogging up the intersection.   It does work at Ashwoody Trail which like West Nancy only has one lane.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"DN your coment doesn't make sense. If you live in Bernwick you can either take a left or right when you leave. The point is the thousands of car leaving the hospital shouldn't be allowed to make an ilegal turn and go back down Old Johnson Ferry. If you are concerned about folks in the negiborhood then move the U turn south of New Generations.

Have you noticed that most cars at the Nancy Creek/Ashford Dunwoody lights heading east turn right anyway. Far better for them to not be allowed to take the illegal U turn and instead use Johnson Ferry totally bypassing Nancy Creek which is a residential road.

As for the consultant and ""offical"" please don't treat us like idiots. We can all read your spin about how successful PTOP is on the website. Its clear you have measured ""success"" on the accelerated thru speed for commuters on Ashford Dunwoody and don't care about people who live in the Nancy Creek area. Its clear the back up is much worse than a year ago. I bet for every car that goes faster on Ashford Dunwoody another is slowed on Nancy Creek. How about doing something for people who actually live here as oppsed to big business and drivers using Brookhaven as a cut thru to avoid the i285. People have asked for years for a safe crossing at Montgomery and get nothing, people have asked for years to start ticketing drivers running the red lights at Ashford Dunwoody and we get nothing. It seems all you care about are helping people drive quicker thru Brookhaven.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"I was going to say the same thing.   Its unfortunate but the amount of traffic generated by St. Joseph's expansion led to that ""compromise"".     So for now a better alternative may be going out the Peachtree Dunwoody exit of St. Joseph's.     I will sometimes go through St. Joseph's to get to the Medical Center Marta station by going out from the traffic circle to Peachtree Dunwoody that way instead of going on Johnson Ferry to that intersection.    All the stop signs and speed bumps drag out the drive but at least its not backed up.   

What they should do is build a road to the back of the Medical Center MARTA station from Perimeter Summit Parkway, or at least a pedestrian walkway.   That way we could get to the train without going all the way out to Peachtree Dunwoody which requires walking up a slight hill and then back down to the station. 

I would not want to see the full Glenridge Connector plan built ( 400 to the Bridge to no where) but with those Townhomes being built in the path of the Glenridge Connector, I don't think that is a risk.

When the roundabout was first installed, a curb was built that jutted out from the circle towards the stop light at Johnson Ferry to prevent the left turn (look at the road there and you can see the ""ghost"" of that curb).  Somewhere along the line, it was removed and it should be replaced as it would at best prevent left turns and at the least make it much more difficult.  What official could make that happen?

I live on Parkcrest and in the last few months there is a massive increase in cars speeding up the street in the late afternoon as drivers are getting frustrated with the delay at the Ashford Dunwoody lights. This is making the street and area unsafe for walkers and children and most of these drivers are from St Josephs and have made an illegal U-turn to begin with.

Also, someone in Sandy Spings should know why the teardrop curb was removed and why St. Joseph's is permitted to dump all of their traffic onto our neighborhood streets.  I firmly believe that they need to be made part of the solution and need to direct traffic onto Peachtree Dunwoody rather than sending it out onto Old Johnson Ferry.

It looks like rather than fix the problem all Sandy Springs have done is changed the signs to now make it an offical roundabout at St Josephs. Today I noticed more cars than ever racing thru the side streets off West Nancy Creek. Can we either have an update or who do we have to raise this to?

Also can someone please tell me how we can get at least one Brookhaven patrol car on Parkcrest as I also noticed a lot of cars speeding up Parkcrest today so to avoid the intersection and instead head back down Ashford Dunwoody. This behaviour makes a mockery of the signalling changes as all it does is make people drive through residential streets even more. I also agree we need real speed humps on West Nancy and Parkcrest.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Sorry for the delay in updating on this issue.  I did talk with Sandy Springs last month and have followed up with them several times, but they are still looking into it from their end.  Unfortunately, this is not as urgent an issue to them as it is to us in Brookhaven.  I have asked them about the changes in the island and they said they needed to pull the development plans for the office on the corner of JF/OJF to find out if and why it was removed before they can do anything, including adding a “No U-Turn Sign” at the roundabout.  

I have also worked with the PTOP consultant to relook at the timings as W Nancy and Ashford Dunwoody.  They have added a few more seconds to W Nancy in the afternoon, which may help some, but is not going to solve the problem.  I am also working with our PD to get them to patrol and look into the speeding issue on Parkcrest Dr.

This issue is of a concern to us.  However, in looking at it, there are no quick fixes that the City can implement that will solve the issue.  If we make improvements to the intersection at W Nancy/Ashford Dunwoody whether adding turn lanes or adjusting timing, that is just going to encourage more cars from Johnson Ferry to cut through. We continue to work to optimize the timing of this intersection, but in the afternoon it is already saturated on both roads. To add time to one direction takes it away from the other and backs up traffic further.  Both Old Johnson Ferry and West Nancy Creek have traffic calming measures in place to reduce speeding and discourage cut trough’s and while the speeding is not the issue, the cut through traffic is not being discouraged from using that route.

I am continuing to work on addressing this issue, working with PCID and Sandy Springs on the overall traffic situation, and including working contacting St Joes to discuss their signage and also talking to their employees about the use of that drive/roundabout on Old Johnson Ferry.  We are also started to work on our Comprehensive Transportation Plan.  The Ashford Dunwoody Corridor, including W Nancy Creek Dr and the cut through traffic issue in this area have been identified as problem areas that need to be addressed in our plan.  This plan will guide and set priorities for transportation improvements citywide.  I encourage you to participate in the process by contacting a steering committee member (found on the CTP page on the city website: http://brookhavenga.gov/city-government/boards-commissions/steering-committees , attending the Steering Committee and Public meetings to provide input, submit comments to the Transportation Email, and participate in surveys and other public outreach that the City and their Consultant will be doing throughout this process.

I just looked on the City website and found that there was a meeting earlier this week that I knew nothing about.  And no where can I find the names of the people on the steering committee.  It would be very helpful if you could provide a little more information.  I would be very happy to contact one or more of the Steering Committee members and to provide photographs and information about the removal of the curb and the No U-Turn sign from the roundabout at Old Johnson Ferry.  I will also provide photographs of the signage on the St. Joseph's campus which dumps their traffic onto the roundabout and subsequently onto our residential streets. ,2014-04-29T21:56:28-04:00,2014-04-29T21:56:28-04:00,397030,AnneH,Guest,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Just to be clear, the CTP committees are NOT about cities like Sandy Springs or companies like St. Joseph violating terms of development agreements and unilaterally dumping traffic on to local streets in DeKalb.     

This traffic circle was put in with the no U-turn and curbs  as a part of the condition for that office space that they have on the corner.   I think people need to contact St. Joseph and push for those development plans and agreed to conditions that Richard references. 

As to individual engineering or signage on an intersection that is not what the CTP is supposed to be about.   As I was told this is just a means to meet State Government requirements for developing an an overall master transportation plan.     Thus its not about deciding where traffic calming goes or where a street sign gets installed or a timing of a traffic light.  Its a mile high look down at the future not a street signage, traffic signal, or traffic calming inquiry.

As to the goal of reducing traffic and congestion, with Dunwoody approving tons of Office Space just across the flyover bridge without a component of residential space in the Perimeter Community Improvement District PCID so that more people who work in PCID can live in the PCID traffic will just get worse.    We can't close the street down and we can't pave our way out of congestion since as we have learned in the past ""if you build it they will come""      

So if you 4 lane Ashford Dunwoody, more people will use Old Johnson Ferry to get to West Nancy Creek to get to it. 

I would take the pictures of the intersection to St. Joseph's, perhaps get one of the local newspapers to write an article.    The conditions that led to this traffic circle being installed were related to that empty lot where Old Johnson Ferry used to go through.  St. Joseph's did all that, and paid for it, so that they could develop that lot in the future.   And I recall specifically that the curb and other features were a part of the agreed condition that they would not let St. Joseph's traffic turn left onto Old Johnson Ferry.     Unfortunately, I was just a tangential participant so I did not retain or work on the specific conditions.  I just was at the meeting where they were agreed to.    And once the approval plans for that lot are pulled it should be there, or St. Joseph's should have it or whoever keeps the development records for Byrnwyck may have it since their representatives were very active.  

As to speeding I've noticed Sandy Springs has a couple of solar powered permanent signs that detect your speed.   It's not a big trailer, just a sign under the existing speed limit sign.   This would be helpful since many people who speed do it unconsciously, alternatively it shames the speeder when a pedestrian or neighbor is near by and can see just how fast the car is driving and perhaps take a plate #..

Or is that the forum where there will be an attempt to 4 lane Ashford Dunwoody (which would be a total disaster to those of us who live in these neighborhoods as you point out)? If that is where plans will be made to destroy our communities, we need to become very involved.

With respect to the Old Johnson Ferry roundabout,  I actually have pictures of the roundabout from several angles showing the ""ghost"" where the curb was taken out.  And we have Google Maps pictures of the missing No U Turn sign.  I am happy to and will write letters to the Brookhaven Reporter and the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

You say that we should obtain the approval plans for that lot -- I have no idea how to go about that or even where to start.  And, in your view, would St. Josephs likely produce anything that shows they have operated in bad faith?  It clearly seems that the guilty party here is St. Josephs -- perhaps abetted by Sandy Springs.  If you can point us in the right direction, we'll give it a go.

Curb physically removed 15 months ago, U turn sign 3 months ago, new sign errected two weeks ago. I note these actions roughly align with the increasing extra congestion at West Nancy Creek/Ashford Dunwoody.

So in a nutshell one sign has been physically removed and another has been put up. Either there is a Sandy Springs work order showing this happened or not. I cannot imagine a curb can be removed in the middle of the lanes, another curb lowered on the sidewalk edge and sign changed without some kind of offical consent unless St Joes got a contractor to do this illegally who had access to signage.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Sandy Springs PW got back with me this week.  They have acknowledged that the No U-turn sign is missing and they have a work order in place to replace the sign with a new one.  With the NO U turn sign in place, COSS PD will be able to enforce and write citations.

Regarding the roundabout sign, that is a standard sign for roundabouts required by the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) the standards we (and Sandy Springs) must follow.  It is a regulatory sign indicating to a motorist to circle to the right instead of cutting the wrong way to the left.  Placement of that sign does not mean that a U-turn is permitted.

As for the changes to the curb, there records indicate that the curb was always like it is now and that the office development on the southeast corner of Old Johnson Ferry and Johnson Ferry and their drive on Old JF was there before the roundabout was built.  If their information is incorrect, i would contact Sandy Springs PW directly.  Please note that based on the dates provided above, Sandy Springs either was not a city yet or was just starting themselves, and many of the staff currently there were not there back in 2006-07

I will continue to work with Sandy Springs and PCID to contact St Josephs about clarifying signage and to inform their employees to not make illegal u-turns at the roundabout.

We will also continue to address this issue as part of the CTP process.  The CTP looks at all of the traffic and transportation issues in the city.  From that process, a plan is developed identifying the potential projects, the general scope of those projects, budget estimates, and, based on anticipated funding, a prioritization and timeline for implementing any projects.  While it does need to address long term (20 year) horizon, it will also look at the short term and determine what improvements will be made in the next 5-10 years.  This is a citizen driven process and citizen input into what needs to be done and what is important to you is a large piece of determining the plan and the final project list.  The master schedule for the CTP and the other plans underway (Land Use, Parks, Buford Hwy) is posted on the city website: http://brookhavenga.gov/city-government/boards-commissions/steering-commitees/transportation-

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Dear Richard Meehan
The Sandy Springs Department of Public Works is clearly not telling or doesn't have the entire story.  The photo attached (Google Maps October 2012) clearly shows that there was a teardrop curb that made illegal left turns impossible and also shows the missing No U Turn sign.  Further, the date of construction of the office building on the southeast corner of Old Johnson Ferry and Johnson Ferry and their drive on Old JF is a matter of public record which will be easier for you to obtain that for us plain citizens to ferret out.

While we appreciate what you have done so far, there is much more that we need to resolve this very terrible situation.  And, again, I hope that you will contact Councilperson Rebecca Chase Williams who lives in Byrnwyck and who should be very sensitive to this traffic nightmare.

Please read my previous message:  we voted for the city of Brookhaven to have elected officials and an administration represent us -- not to be told that we need to contact the Sandy Springs Department of Public Works.  And please pursue getting the original documents referenced in the Dunwoody Crier article in which St. Joseph's pledged not to dump traffic into our neighborhoods in exchange for the construction of the roundabout.

Thank you for prodding Sandy Springs to replace the no UTurn sign.  It is also mission critical to hold St. Josephs accountable for their signage and the subsequent dumping of their traffic into our neighborhoods.  Thank you.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Richard, asking St. Joseph's to put in a ""request"" that their employees not make illegal u-turns at the roundabout is first of all not the answer, and secondly, it's a tiny, tiny Band-Aid on a huge, gaping wound.  Thank you for offering to plan a meeting to this effect, but that just isn't even good use of your time, in my opinion.  I venture to say it's not the employees who are the major problem.  St. Joseph's agreed not to route traffic through the W. Nancy Creek area, and somewhere that agreement is memorialized.  It is not up to us, the citizens of Brookhaven and this immediate neighborhood to approach the City of SS and/or to bring the documents to light or enforce the terms of the agreement.  It doesn't matter who was employed by the City of SS ""back when"" -- the documents and agreement should speak for themselves and should remain enforceable no matter who is employed or elected since then, and we ask you and the elected/appointed officials of Brookhaven to speak for us and put pressure on City of SS AND the hospital.  I agree with Anne H. that I hope Rebecca will get involved in this crucial matter since she lives in Byrnwyck, AND she is our councilperson.  Before we signed the contract to purchase our home in Murphey Candler Park 35 years ago we came to the area in the late afternoon to monitor the traffic flow during ballpark season/hours.

Second, Eric, I know that I was confused the first time someone mentioned the ""teardrop curb"" so I went to the circle and looked. I've attached the picture I posted on May 6 and have added red lines to show when the ""curb"" or perhaps yellow lines were originally that reinforced the No U-Turn sign.

Third, Richard:  we are all getting quite impatient about the lack of any real progress on this matter.  When you read the article that Eric referenced from the Dunwoody Crier in 2006, it is quite clear that St. Joseph's has broken many of the promises made as a condition of getting approval for the round about.

In terms of curbs: 

1, If you head up the hill from St Josephs towards Johnson Ferry as you past the island (to your left) on your right there was a curb before the sidewalk. This curb was removed making it easier for a car to swing around to make a U turn. Before the curb made it harder. I remember watching cars take 2 or 3 attempts to make the U turn before this was removed as it restricted the turnng circle. This is one curb that has been removed.

2, There used to be a curb extened from the island to block U turns. This has been removed.

Thanks,

Janice

If it doesn't help then other measures can be looked at.    

As to the Ashford Dunwoody and West Nancy Creek Intersection.    Is Brookhaven looking into the earlier suggestion of replacing that light with a light that has an arrow?   That shouldn't be a big issue.  Once you do that you can then set the light to provide some time for eastbound West Nancy Creek Traffic to turn left/South on to Ashford Dunwoody.   It works at the Oak Forest/AD intersection and at the Savoy Chamblee Dunwoody intersection.      This needs to be done now.  You don't need a turn lane, just a signal with an arrow.

This should absolutely NOT be the responsibility of any neighborhood association.  We voted in the City of Brookhaven to represent us and that is who should be dealing with this.  Not only should they pressure Sandy Springs, they need to ferret out the original documents St. Josephs signed at the time the roundabout was accepted. I attended the recent ""interactive"" meeting of the Brookhaven Transportation Steering Committee and spoke with Richard Meehan at some length.  He has apparently dropped the ball on this one.

Second, NOTHING -- or even less than nothing -- should be done to facilitate eastbound traffic from West Nancy Creek.  That will just encourage all of the cut through traffic and the dumping of St. Joseph's traffic onto Old Johnson Ferry and West Nancy Creek.  Besides that, 95% of those people are making a right turn to head south on Ashford Dunwoody.  It is the westbound  neighborhood traffic that can't make a left turn to head south on Ashford Dunwoody between 5:30 and 6:15 or so on most weeknight evenings.  I go through the intersection several times a week during the height of the ugliness and can tell you that adding a left turn signal for the eastbound traffic would have few users.

Again, this should not be the responsibility of citizens.  If it becomes our responsibility, then why do we need/pay for government representatives?

As to the West Nancy Creek and Ashford Dunwoody, that is my bad.  I meant Westbound NOT Eastbound.     Richard Meehan, I'm suggesting the arrow solution because what's happening now is Westbound traffic on East Nancy Creek trying to make that left on to Southbound Ashford Dunwoody is only getting 3 to 4 cars through because of all the eastbound traffic making a Right Hand turn to go south and thus having the right of way over the westbound cars.

Regarding the signal at Ashford Dunwoody/West Nancy Creek, we have had our consultant look at the option of ""split"" phasing the signal for West Nancy Creek which is what was suggested above.  According to them, split phasing would not improve the traffic situation on W Nancy creek and could actually make it worse as will reduce the overall green time available.  Right now, W Nancy is getting about 49 seconds of green time per cycle (this is an increase of what it was when we started looking at this issue).  When you split phase, this green time would be split between the two approaches and will require additional yellow and all red time which will effectively reduce the overall green time.

We are continuing to look at this issue a work to develop options to help improve the traffic situation.  In discussion with our Police Chief and City Manager, we are going to add ""No Through Traffic"" signs on Old Johnson Ferry at the City Limits.  While these signs are not enforceable, they may help to let drivers know they are not supposed to cut through.

We are also in the process of making operation improvements to the intersection of Johnson Ferry and Ashford Dunwoody which will reduce the Southbound backup on both these roads.  While not removing all of the cut through traffic, this should help reduce it.  We expect this work, which will consist of restripping and signal improvements, is expected to start this summer and be completed in early fall.

Richard, we'll look forward to the No Through Traffic signs -- and it would be really good if Sandy Springs would restore the striping to reinforce the No U Turn sign at the traffic teardrop.  Also, the ""rotary"" sign on Old Johnson Ferry needs to be replaced with one that indicates one cannot go all the way around the island -- in other words, it ought to be a horseshoe rather than a circle.

With respect to Eric's most recent post, I absolutely agree that there has been no input sought about whatever the plan is for the Ashford Dunwoody/Johnson Ferry intersection.  There are many aspects of this that would warrant well-publicized open meetings for discussion:  for those northbound through the intersection on Ashford Dunwoody Road, for example, left turns into the Cambridge Shopping Center should be prohibited from 5 pm to 7 pm as should left turns out of the shopping center onto Ashford Dunwoody northbound.  Those wishing to enter or exit the shopping center during those hours should do so via Johnson Ferry.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Has any progress been made on getting a new traffic light for this intersection?  This intersection needs to be like the one just up the Street at Ashford Dunwoody and Oak Forrest/Perimeter Summit.  Oak Forrest Drive does not have a turn lane but instead has a left turn signal that goes on with the Green Light.  The Green and light and left arrow then switches over to the other side of Ashford Dunwoody to Perimeter Summit to allow that traffic to move.

I understand how the Consultant came to his conclusion (relayed by Richard M on 6-10) that this ""split"" timing would not improve any thing because it leads to less total green light time for West Nancy Creek traffic.    

However the Consultant made a mistake I assume because he is not aware of the traffic flows and the fact that traffic depending on the time of day is heavily tilted to eastbound traffic coming from Sandy Springs.    

Split timing could dramatically reduce the westbound West Nancy Creek green light  time dramatically  and still improve the situation dramatically.    As it stands now the encroaching westbound cars trying to squeeze between the non stop eastbound traffic turning right to go south or going straight creates more confusion and also leaves the intersection non functional for westbound West Nancy Creek traffic.   In other words, in the afternoon westbound West Nancy Creek traffic east of Ashford Dunwoody in effect has no Green Light time.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Richard:  I agree with Eric on this one.  When I absolutely must go south on Ashford Dunwoody between 5:30 and 6:30 most weeknights, I come close to developing road rage at the never ending stream of eastbound traffic and the truly clueless drivers headed west on Nancy Creek who just sit there like lumps rather than moving out into the intersection.  The other night, it took 3 light cycles before I could get through the intersection.

Even with the no U turn sign up at the Old Johnson Ferry traffic horseshoe, there are plenty of cars coming out of St. Joseph that just ignore it and make the U turn anyway.  It would be helpful to ask that Sandy Springs occasionally put a car in the parking lot of the office building there and issue some tickets -- also, please remind them that they need to restripe that area to reinforce the No U turn message.  Right now we are in what should a bit of a lull in the traffic with vacations and no school traffic.  It can and will get worse.",2014-07-01T18:28:56-04:00,2014-07-01T18:28:56-04:00,,AnneH,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Just wondering status of this issue.  Traffic continues to back up east and west-bound on W. Nancy Creek at Ashford Dunwoody (especially morning and mid-to-late afternoons).  We have asked repeatedly over the past year+ that adjustment be made to the timing of this light.  Never seems to be any improvement in light timing.  Headed west on W. Nancy Creek, and turning left on Ashford Dunwoody (when the light finally turns green and traffic clears enough to make a left turn there) almost ALWAYS when you then get to Marist / Harts Mill, that light is red for Ashford Dunwoody drivers.  Please give West Nancy Creek drivers a longer (and more frequent green light) !",2014-10-11T13:22:03-04:00,2014-10-11T13:22:03-04:00,,JG,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"As I said before the best and easiest solution is to replace the traffic light with a traffic light with a left hand turn signal the one at the intersection of Oak Forest/Perimeter Summit and Ashford Dunwoody or the one at the intersection of Savoy and Chamblee Dunwoody.    Then you give east bound and westbound Ashford Dunwoody their own green light cycles as is done at the above mentioned intersections.    The total time could be less than the time given now but you would move more cars since you don't have the issue of cars stopping and starting because of the conflicting turn movement situation you have now. 

as seen at Oak Forest you don't need a dedicated turn lane to make that work.

Think about it, if it works just up the street at Oak Forest where they have higher traffic counts why wouldn't it work just down the street at West Nancy.      ",2014-10-17T13:11:00-04:00,2014-10-17T13:11:00-04:00,374630,Eric,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,This seems to be to completely different topics in this one thread. One is the missing u turn in sandy springs the other being the intersection at AD/ Nancy Creek. With another person noting the u-turn is back how do we ensure that we have issues with more clarity since this one spans to different items. Thanks . ,2014-11-30T20:29:38-05:00,2014-11-30T20:29:38-05:00,110864,Douglas,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/714982,"Douglas, true, though both points are related.  The issue started with the need for a timing adjustment or new traffic light with turn signal at Ashford Dunwoody and West Nancy Creek like the one at Perimeter Summit-Oak Forrest and Ashford Dunwoody. 

The problem is that with the amount of traffic coming from Pill Hill its impossible to make a left hand turn from West Nancy Creek on to Ashford Dunwoody if you are coming from Murphey Candler Lake. 

Many later correctly noted that the U-Turn sign was missing.   This seemingly simple task to a great deal of time to resolve.  And the fact that many from the St. Joseph campus were doing a U-Turn here was cited as a problem since the design of the teardrop was to discourage use of Old Johnson Ferry as a cut through by making this U-Turn illegal.    The question is, has the sign stopped this practice?  Is Sandy Springs enforcing it.  

But I suspect even if Sandy Springs does enforce the No-U-Turn the Ashford Dunwoody and West Nancy Creek intersection will still be dysfunctional at Rush Hour.  

Brookhaven earlier had responded that the PCID's consultants had set the timing of the lights to optimize traffic flow [I suspect with an eye towards giving Perimeter Center Commuters the maximum green time].     Though adjusting the light to provide some more green time for West Nancy would not hurt traffic from the PCID since this light is not where traffic is backing up.  

However, even with that, the amount of traffic and the uncertainty of the situtation at rush hour with high volumes of on coming traffic I think dictate use of a signal with a turn signal so that each direction of West Nancy gets there own period of time when the signal is green.   By removing the uncertainty you not only can move more cars in less time but you will also improve safety.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/527088,"Sandy Springs and Brookhaven need to work together on this. In the am, traffic backs up significantly and unnecessarily on Windsor going west at the same intersection. In the evenings, due to a stop sign that makes no sense at Mabry/windsor (Brookhaven), traffic backs up significantly on Windsor going east. So even if SS gives you a longer turning signal, you will have the same issue you have now. The two cutis should work together to ease traffic during both rush hour commutes. Ultimately, though, there are more people living in the area and traffic volume will be great and cannot be avoided. At the same time, I agree a few adjustments can help.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/462174,"Those planters have been there for 5 years, as an attempt to show support to holidays. I do agree they need to be looked at, but not just the flags, overall all of it. This shopping center created a farmers market on Thursdays to bring in people, and all the city can bring them now is grief. I get Dekalb was a big county but a loud enough person (with such clear knowledge of the sections in violation) would have had this addressed. Or contact the leasing company, their number is clearly posted on the for lease spaces. Would potentially the very bright LED lights on the cleaners, which the Kroger one recently did the same create some type of driving hazard as well?  

Corner Pizza added a flag and they could ""possibly"" be in violation for improper placement? The flag being used for advertising tool, that is completely subjective and I highly suggest you take a look around at places with US Flags. In my book, a car dealership with a GIANT US Flag to draw attention would be doing the same thing. For being someone so patriotic for the flag, leave Corner Pizza alone. 

Brookhaven - If you allow people to report stuff, this website should really require people to at least have an account. It seems cowardly to post sections of code as ""anonymous"". I hope the city takes that into consideration in requiring that. If not, this website will diminish in value, add credibility. In the time to post this, or research the sections of code, the person could have created account. If they were driving, they should not violate the law of texting (essentially what you are doing) while behind the wheel of an automobile. 

 If the City has the time for someone to go to Corner Pizza and review a potential placement issue, this city currently has too much time on it's hands already. ",2013-04-12T12:46:01-04:00,2013-04-12T12:46:01-04:00,110864,Douglas,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

Again , welcome and a great benefit of the city. Now that we have a city, lets complain about a place around for half a decade - boo hoo. This has probably been around longer then most people complaining being residences . Started about complaints about flags . Maybe we can submit all of our neighborhoods for code compliance review too, no doubt would find something. Maybe people thought this is Phipps mall - or maybe the next and how about we just demand things to a place where restaurants go under as is. These little restaurants will all be there is with the new construction now having no restaurants as part of the plan . 

Regarding code staffing - seriously ? It is a matter of staffing - there no doubt is tons of other places that are violations of a bigger nature . One less code person and study and fix the traffic here - but by the replies I can see how this item is high importance . I suggest we create the flag police , plenty of my neighbors do have them up, our HOA covenants so no but look at the cases , never going to fly legally. 

A flag being used for advertising ... This thread has turned into people demanding a shopping center to be revamped cause we dont like it ... off the mark now a so has the entire point of this site . Goes into how people report the same thing 3 times cause they can't figure it out --- not create a login. Not worth the time for people who have irrational expectations in 6 months of a city.

Unfortunately, even  greater is the opportunity to create a clearinghouse for ill will and animosity between neighbors as is evidenced by this one issue.  The owner has receive harassing phone calls and death threats for her stance on the new city and viewpoints. Really? For being part of the process?  My comments will remain anonymous for similar reasons.   I also believe aesthetic improvements are necessary, there's no love lost on the property,  but are we going to be neighbors that continually use public forums to report each other for minor violations? No, this will be my first and last posting.  I also think this this should be a yes-no vote for prioritization, not a forum, which I'm guilty of. 

Take a look across the street on the boundary of Cambridge Park at the dilapidated fencing, dumping of yard debris on right of way and unsightly brush and trees growing on the right of way and power lines before casting too many stones.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/266169,"I think this ""improvement"" is another example of a knee-jerk reaction to a problem which does more harm than good. Atlanta's roads are being ruined one intersection at a time by these poorly-planned solutions.  Drivers can no longer turn right on red at this intersection in even moderate traffic, since there is no right turn lane any more.  Instead, there is a new curb which serves only to block traffic.

If the goal is to snarl traffic, why not make one lane of North Highland Ave a full-time bike lane, like was done recently to westbound 10th Street?  How about planting a giant Oak tree in the middle of the intersection of Piedmont and Monroe? Why not make the 4 left lanes of the Grady curve a drive-thru car wash?   

The lack of a comprehensive city-wide traffic plan is obvious.  ",2013-09-02T08:19:34-04:00,2013-09-02T08:19:34-04:00,151717,atlengdave,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project is the first part of that effort. We are also currently installing intelligent traffic signals that will be coordinated through a central monitoring location so they can be adjusted for special events (such as shows at the Fox), congestion, accidents, rush hour and so on.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/154459,"Thank you for contacting the DeKalb County Citizen Help Center. I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. Ramps, Interstate and State Roads and signs referring to the Interstate or State Roads are maintained by Georgia DOT. The area in question is handles by the Atlanta Division of the Georgia DOT in which I am still awaiting a response to my request for an email address in which to forward your concerns.  I’m not sure if a sign will help or if police presence is needed but because the issue happens on the ramp, GADOT will need to be involved. There is a “contact us” section on the  Georgia DOT’s website that you may want to visit:  http://www.dot.state.ga.us/misc/Pages/ContactUs.aspx

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/135449,"Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for contacting the Citizen Help Center.

Service Request #1187197 has been submitted to the Roads and Drainage Department to patch/pave the area. Below please find information on the paving process.

 

The Roads and Drainage Division responds to requests for street resurfacing and/or paving. Each year a DeKalb County road rating engineering technician inspects approximately 2,115 miles of County roadway (consisting of more than 8,122 streets) using elements of the Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT) pavement condition rating system to evaluate the structural condition of the roadways.

NOTE: The Asphalt Division of Roads and Drainage can supply road/street ratings and can be reached at 404.297.2563.

Twelve kinds of pavement distress are evaluated and each road will have a score between 0 and 60. Those streets with ratings of 30 or higher are eligible for submission to the Georgia DOT for possible resurfacing under their Local Assistance Resurfacing Program (LARP).

The schedule for street resurfacing is available on the County website (also see attached document)

http://www.co.dekalb.ga.us/publicwrks/roads_drainage/pdf/pavingList.pdf

We are unable to provide an estimate at this time on when the street will be resurfaced. We can send out a technician to inspect the conditions for patching and fill potholes.

 

 

 

Please feel free to call us at “311” within DeKalb County or 404 371-2000 outside of DeKalb County if we can further assist you.

 

 

Sincerely,

A:The Roads and Drainage Division responds to requests for street resurfacing and/or paving. Each year a DeKalb County road rating engineering technician inspects approximately 2,115 miles of County roadway (consisting of more than 8,122 streets) using elements of the Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT) pavement condition rating system to evaluate the structural condition of the roadways.

Twelve kinds of pavement distress are evaluated and each road will have a score between 0 and 60. Those streets with ratings of 30 or higher are eligible for submission to the Georgia DOT for possible resurfacing under their Local Assistance Resurfacing Program (LARP).

The schedule for street resurfacing is available on the County website (also see attached document)

http://www.co.dekalb.ga.us/publicwrks/roads_drainage/pdf/pavingList.pdf

We are unable to provide an estimate at this time on when the street will be resurfaced. We can send out a technician to inspect the conditions for patching and fill potholes.

Thank you for contacting the Citizen Help Center.

Service Request #1165036 has been submitted to the roads and Drainage department. Below, please find the criteria for road paving:

 

The Roads and Drainage Division responds to requests for street resurfacing and/or paving. Each year a DeKalb County road rating engineering technician inspects approximately 2,115 miles of County roadway (consisting of more than 8,122 streets) using elements of the Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT) pavement condition rating system to evaluate the structural condition of the roadways.

Twelve kinds of pavement distress are evaluated and each road will have a score between 0 and 60. Those streets with ratings of 30 or higher are eligible for submission to the Georgia DOT for possible resurfacing under their Local Assistance Resurfacing Program (LARP).

The schedule for street resurfacing is available on the County website:

http://www.co.dekalb.ga.us/publicwrks/roads_drainage/pdf/pavingList.pdf

We can not provide an estimate at this time on when the street will be resurfaced. We can send out a technician to inspect the conditions for patching and fill potholes.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/120300,"Clairmont road is 4 lanes of heavy traffic due to the fact it bridges a large employment center including CDC, Emory, and the VA amongst many other offices and high density residential complexes in the area.

An auto is heading southbound and wants to turn left on Desmond (Desmond is a major cut through) to bypass the heavy traffic that gets clogged going southbound to North Decatur Rd.   There is a short left hand turn lane. (holds about 4 - 5 cars) The car sits at the left hand turn lane and there are 2 problems at this point:

1.   The amount of traffic lining up to turn left from Clairmont to Desmond can be significant and the left turn lane, again, is short.  This causes major traffic backup north up Clairmont Road as drivers on Clairmont Road heading south past this intersection only have one lane until they get past the intersection.  During rush hour the one lane backup can go all the way past the VA complex.
2.  The cars traveling northbound on Clairmont typically travel fast (an understatement), and are traveling fast around a sharp curve.  Its difficult to see them autos traveling around that intersection until the last few seconds.

To recap, an auto wants to turn left and often does not have the space which causes a traffic jam down Clairmont.  An auto wants to turn left and has poor visibility of oncoming northbound traffic.

Finally, another auto travels west on Desmond to the intersection of Clairmont.  The car wants to turn left to head south on Clairmont.  The auto has to cross 5 lanes (including the left turn lane on Clairmont) and navigate cars speeding around a sharp corner to their left (heading north), as well as heavy traffic heading south.

This intersection is a death trap and needs a traffic light before someone gets killed.  This is no joke.  Is it going to take someone having blood on their hands before it gets addressed?",2013-11-01T09:36:44-04:00,2013-11-01T09:36:44-04:00,125611,Rick,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/120300,"Agreed it's a dangerous turn where you feel like a sitting duck and the Desmond traffic pulls so far forward up the hill so they can see out to Claremont that it increases the radius of the left turn required to clear their car when you do get to make your left. But as a resident off Ava, off Desmond, id prefer if you just blocked the entrance to neighbors only. No more cutters!

Dekalb county Roads and Drainage is not taking the responsibility to pave an official county road I called ""planning & design"" they said we do not have a plan for this road & dekalb county ""roads & drainage"" said its not their responsibility but I spoke to Mr. Jim McKenny cell# 4042974583 I told him that the unpaved road is forming channels preventing us from driving down the street to reach our homes he promised to pour some curbs to control the water flow but he disappeared & never answer my calls anymore please come take a look at a COUNTY ROAD in the USA.
Few weeks ago, we had a major piping damage to the water and sewer on kelly street, we contacted the Dekalb county about the issue, they did not take responsibility and they did not do anything about it, they said that they cannot service this road! They are stealing taxes from us, my tax bill was almost $2000 this year, I paid it and I dont even have service, I am wondering if the Federal Government should get involve and take charges agains Dekalb County! Plus the water bill now is over $150 we call again they said to check arround the house and the home piping, I got a plumber and checked the home piping but nothing! I dont know what else to do, what kind of services is this!
I am also worried about the water and sewer piping, if both are broken and they are mixed up, than the Dekalb County is delivering to us sewer to the house, we have kids and we care about ourselves if they dont! We demand a quick and effective solution and right now, its not only one house, mine and few houses down the street ""KELLY ST"" OFFICIAL DEKALB COUNTY ROAD
I need your help, I already sent a complaint thru BBB, I dont really know who is the responsible that I have to speak to, they turned me down and they keep turning me down since 2011, but I had enough I need a solution now, if you cannot help please get me in touch with the head of Dekalb County because I dont want to stay quiet anymore, thank you ",2013-01-29T17:59:11-05:00,2013-01-29T17:59:11-05:00,,Matt,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Roads and Drainage Division responds to requests for street resurfacing and/or paving. Each year a DeKalb County road rating engineering technician inspects approximately 2,115 miles of County roadway (consisting of more than 8,122 streets) using elements of the Georgia Department of Transportation's (DOT) pavement condition rating system to evaluate the structural condition of the roadways.

Twelve kinds of pavement distress are evaluated and each road will have a score between 0 and 60. Those streets with ratings of 30 or higher are eligible for submission to the Georgia DOT for possible resurfacing under their Local Assistance Resurfacing Program (LARP).

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/8537,"Hi Rebecca,

 

On this particular issue I think signage on the Eastbound lane indicating bicycles may be expected on the road (and/or sharrows) would be an improvement. Drivers are leaving a congested area and accelerating up a slight grade at that point which hides the intersection ahead. The crest of the hill is exactly at a point where the road narrows and turns behind some shrubs, trees and a telephone pole. A stoplight controlled intersection is about 100 feet down the grade and cyclists needing to turn left there must take the lane before rolling to the intersection. Drivers are surprised and annoyed by a cyclist in front of them and honk and pass illegally (crossing double yellow lines) on the left even as cyclists are entering the turn lane. I've been mirror brushed many times at this location. I am getting worried that my nine lives are up!

 

My other concern was about how Click Fix works to address issues. I did not see any feedback and was concerned that this was just an internet complaint slot with no bottom! I appreciate your response even if no action is taken on this issue.

Regarding your question about See Click Fix, it does have the potential to be an endless complaint loop, you are so right!  

I've frankly been overwhelmed with the initial volume of issues reported - I set up an Atlanta and a Decatur reporting area and have been forwarding complaints to the relevant local government to the extent possible.  Please bear with me, and if you can help out by helping me build political support for improvements that would be much appreciated.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7260,"Mary, Adam & Ted,  one of my neighborhood watch groups sent out the attached information concerning traffic calming programs within neighborhoods. 
 
All the documents contain information on how to address speeders in your neighborhood & what the county requires to put in bumps.  I’m not sure how recent this information is, but here is a link to the “traffic calming” website which also includes information about sidewalks.  http://www.co.dekalb.ga.us/publicwrks/transportation/tr_faq.html#calming
 
The process in getting bumps must work because Creekdale Drive got them installed which made a huge difference after years of problems with speeders.
 
Mary & Adam, if you get push back from the Transportation Dept. on addressing the sidewalk, let me know.  We have a member of CALI who is in that department and we can use her influence to help.  Keep me posted….
 
Q.
How to I request a sidewalk to be installed on my street?
A.
To request a sidewalk, please call (770) 492-5204. A staff member of the Transportation Division will conduct a site visit of the area, develop a cost estimate and determine the priority of the request. Sidewalk requests that are near schools, transit and parks will be given priority over other requests. Priority will also be given to those roads that are classified as a collector, minor thoroughfare or major thoroughfare. Once a priority is established, funding sources will be sought for project construction.
 
Q.
How do I obtain traffic calming in my neighborhood?
A.
DeKalb County has developed a Traffic Calming Program to address the concerns of the citizens within DeKalb County. For a street to be eligible for the traffic calming program, it must be classified as local residential on the DeKalb County Thoroughfare Plan and have a posted speed limit of 30 mph or less. First, call (770) 492-5219 to receive an initial interest petition for your street. This petition is a screening to determine if at least 20% of the residents are interested in learning more about traffic calming. Once the initial interest petition passes, a traffic volume and speed study will be evaluated for all affected areas within the study area. If the study indicates that a speeding or cut though problem exists, then a stakeholders group will be formed and along with DeKalb County staff to develop a traffic calming plan for the area. To ensure citizen input, the development of the plan can take up to one year. The plan will then be presented to the Board of Commissioner’s (BOC) for approval. Once approved by the BOC, a petition for the installation and establishment of a special tax district will be circulated. A minimum of 65% approval from the property owners is required to install traffic calming devices.

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7245,"Yes, we had a site visit over a year ago I believe. Not much to report - the path had been built, the road realigned with less space and not enough room for bike lanes. My goals were to 1) help the city engineer understand why a sidepath would be less useful for city cycling than a bike lane to prevent this from happening in the future and b) to get ramps installed for access from side streets. 

Results were mixed. No ramps have been installed to my knowledge - I was told this was due to ADA, and the need to make the path safe for wheelchair users, which demonstrates why a bicycle lane was preferable in this location. The crossing at Piedmont remains very dangerous, as is the highway access ramp crossing - they did agree to install an additional sign warning of the ramp there. 

I would recommend contacting your city council member and copying the commissioner of public works on the email if you would like to weigh in. We gathered extensive feedback from cyclists but the reality is that once construction has started the advocates are too late. 

We started a neighborhood bicycle liaison program to try to stay better abreast of projects that affect conditions for cycling.

This seems like a great issue to get some local cyclists to rally around. Have you tried contacting the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition (atlantabike.org)? If you get enough of your fellow cyclists involved, you could use SeeClickFix as an online petitioning tool. In larger projects, it is often useful to have a coalition of people working to address the issue with the government.

One way that you can rally support is to go ""old school."" You can use SeeClickFix to print flyers to post in your neighborhood and town. Here is a good example of how the tool has been used in New Haven (http://seeclickfix.blogspot.com/2009/11/reminder-why-we-started-seeclickfix.html).

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7172,"Acknowledged by ABC.

This is a systemic problem in Atlanta.  The reason is that when the Georgia DOT widens or rebuilds a road, they are required to strongly consider installing a bike lane, IF one is in the local bike plan.  So if they are widening 1/2 mile of road, that's how long the resulting bike lane will be.  

Our approach to this problem is to work with local government to take advantage of these existing spurts of bike lanes to create real connections. 

Briarcliff is quite narrow, which makes it hard to fit in bike lanes. I recommend you contact your county commissioner to tell them you want bike lanes on Briarcliff.  http://www.co.dekalb.ga.us/commission.htm

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,"They did this a few years ago, talked to ATL Public Works and got them removed on the right side for about 3 feet, in consideration for cyclists, now they're back, worse.",2009-07-25T04:52:39-04:00,2009-07-25T04:52:39-04:00,,Lisa,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,Acknowledged by ABC - we have mentioned this to the city several times and today were told they are going to remove the 2 feet on the right side of the bump to allow bikes to pass through.  They will also install a reflective strip in front of the bumps.  Ride by next week and let us know if it worked!,2009-08-27T10:35:42-04:00,2009-08-27T10:35:42-04:00,,atlantabike,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,Last time they took out 3 feet. Then all of them. Why did they go back in? And why only take out 2 feet? This is really weird!?!? ,2009-08-28T05:02:24-04:00,2009-08-28T05:02:24-04:00,,Mike and Pam,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,"That's great to hear!   Last night I had to dump out on the grass because of this hazard as a car came about an 1"" of passing me because the vehicle driver had no where to go - and this hole was filled with rain water - yikes!!   I will keep you posted......thanks much.",2009-08-28T10:08:19-04:00,2009-08-28T10:08:19-04:00,,Mike and Pam,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,"Approximately 2 feet of the bumps have been removed from the right side and the remaining surface looks like it has been milled a bit, similar to shallow rumblestrips, but seems fine for riding on. Not sure if there is more work to come. I think there is still an issue with the bumps if riders can't see the removed section in the dark, perhaps the above-mentioned reflective strips will solve this.",2009-08-30T16:20:49-04:00,2009-08-30T16:20:49-04:00,,Lisa,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,"Picture. This still doesn't look safe. There is, as mentioned, 2 feet of bumps removed and milled. That specific section seems fine to ride on, but there's no indication that cyclists should ride only there.

There are some reflective strips, but nothing that would actually indicate that it's something unsuitable for cyclists to cross over.",2009-10-23T07:14:59-04:00,2009-10-23T07:14:59-04:00,291,MidtownCommuter,Registered User,https://seeclickfix.com/files/comment_images/0000/1673/Bike_Hazards_-_25.jpg,https://seeclickfix.com/files/comment_images/0000/1673/Bike_Hazards_-_25_square.jpg,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,"Cars go far too fast here, so the speed bumps are a welcome addition. The portion that was removed next to the curb makes this perfectly passable by bike. This is one of the few times I've been impressed with City of Atlanta: first for installing them, then for actually being responsive and making them better for bicycles.",2009-11-05T10:25:12-05:00,2009-11-05T10:25:12-05:00,,Cabbagetowner,Registered User,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7122,"So what's the general verdict here? Do the people watching this issue find it to be solved to their liking? Is it still unclear what cyclists should do to navigate these bumps safely?
